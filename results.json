I saw it advertised on The Today Show (me posting a review is in no way associated with The Today Show)  and she’d mentioned her quote about Job from the Bible- and I just had to give it a whirl. Well, I flew through it in two days. Her witty humor and relatable life lessons are a duplicitous way to help readers feel not alone. I’ve recently lost my job, and so much of this spoke to me  (esp Job!)- I even started highlighting her quotes!  I’ve been dealing with such thoughts of despair (something I normally never have) and this book had me giggling and taking notes for hard days. I just wish I could sit and have a cup of tea with Kristen to tell her how I felt like I was reading pages upon pages of my life! Well written. Bravo!", "I don't know where to start with this book. It made me laugh, had me in tears, and challenged me to think about a lot of things in a different way. Kristin is so full of love and all about grace when it comes to people and situations in her life. I loved the stories and little thoughts. The book is so beautiful! Every page is art and engages you in fun moments. I will be giving this to so many people as a gift. It's perfect for birthday, graduation, or just if someone needs a hug.", "I was disappointed as I thought it would be more of an autobiographical book. I have t finished it yet.", "Such an interesting, funny, silly memoir. An easy read filled with tongue and cheek advice, personal stories told with humility, grace and humor. Her fascinating  life story would make a wonderful Broadway show or movie and maybe someday she’ll share it with the world but in the meantime pick up this glimpse of an amazing entertainer.", "Quick but fun read. I enjoyed learning more about Kristen C.", "I loved her humor and her thoughts about God. Would have enjoyed more about God and less about show biz. Her prayers were beautiful.", "This was a fun, quick read. Kristin is thoughtful, funny and no B.S.  She made me think, she made me laugh out loud, she made me a bit introspective and she validated me.  You can take what you choose to take from this book. There are  personal stories, suggestions, examples an aha moments.  Very glad I decided to get it.!", "So far I like the book. I especially like Christian Chenoweth .", "I’m still reading it so I only have a partial review."]},

Touches all the emotions, makes you smile. Reads just like your favorite album.", "I love reading because I love stories. That may seem like an obvious statement, but so many non-fiction books are recaps of isolated events or summaries of studies. I enjoy non-fiction (probably more than the average person), but my issue with memoirs is that, too often, they highlight the glamorous bits of the subject’s life, which doesn’t make for a great story. It’s the book version of social media. You want the ups and downs. You want to root for your main character, even if your main character is real and you know the ending already.", "Books, whether fiction or non-fiction, are meant to be stories.", "Enter Dave Grohl’s The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music.", "For the aforementioned reasons, I don’t actively seek out memoirs. But Dave Grohl has always seemed like a genuinely awesome guy, and his music makes its way onto every playlist I’ve ever made. A good bit of Dave Grohl’s music makes up the soundtrack to my life – so naturally, I wanted to learn about his.", "Grohl takes his memoir and lays it out in five parts. He covers everything from:", "his childhood and foray into music", "the singular event that directed the course of his whole life", "his time in a little-known band called Nirvana (sarcasm!)", "the winding path of the Foo Fighters", "and what it means to be a dad – and one of the biggest names in the world", "As expected, Grohl is incredibly relatable. His sunny attitude radiates throughout his words, even when talking about (spoiler alert!) the death of Nirvana’s frontman, Kurt Cobain. Grohl truly tells stories. He doesn’t take you from point to point in a straight line – he takes you on a journey through his life. He may begin a chapter about his daughter, and suddenly you’re in a French psychic’s apartment discussing other dimensions and auras. You’re not left hanging or wondering, “what’s the point of this anecdote?” It all makes sense.", "Unquestionably, Dave Grohl, whether as the drummer for Nirvana or the frontman of the Foo Fighters, has had some genuinely astounding experiences. However, Grohl tells these stories like a lucky dude who happened to be in the right place at the right time. He nerds out over his heroes just like the rest of us and continually cannot believe his fortune as he marvels at his life. That said, Grohl pulls no punches as he shares the choices he made to get to where he is: living on one dollar per day, sleeping on floors, and running down alleys from drug dealers in Europe. Despite what I consider hardships, his wisdom at a young age allowed him to see the big picture and what was possible. He didn’t need a guarantee – he needed a chance.", "The Storyteller is a beautiful story of achieving success on your terms and because of your choices. I hope you find it as inspiring and uplifting as I did.", "He has such a great life-story and has so much to say. Always have been a fan of his- from Nirvana to Foo Fighters. I was looking forward to this and it's a great read!", "Dave's a good writer. Easy to read. Goes quickly.", "TLDR: Engaging book for music lovers, rich in passion and dedication, a great read and gift choice. 📖🎵❤️", "This book transcends mere fanhood of Nirvana or Foo Fighters; it's a testament to a life devoted to the art of music. Written by a man whose life's work is a melody in itself, it's a celebration of creation, listening, and the universal love for music.", "Each page radiates the author's deep passion and unwavering dedication to music. It's not just about the notes and the rhythms; it's about the soul-stirring power of music. The book captures the essence of what it means to live and breathe melodies and harmonies.", "It's become my literary comfort food – the book I reach for in between reads, often finding myself absorbed in its pages again and again. It's one of those rare books that draws you back, time after time, with its enchanting narrative.", "Not only has it been a personal treasure, but it's also my go-to gift for friends. It's the kind of book that I'm confident will resonate with anyone who appreciates music, regardless of their preferred genres.", "If you're on the fence about picking up this book, consider this a gentle nudge. Whether you're a hardcore music aficionado or just enjoy a well-crafted story, this book is a rewarding read. Dive in, and like many before you, you might find yourself thanking me for the recommendation.", "Excelente estado y presentación aún lo estoy leyendo!", "Dave Grohl’s life as a whole is an inspiration. His writing is fun, unassuming, interesting, fun, just like his music is. A complete delight to read.", "Absolutely riveting, I have no idea why its taken me so long to buy this as I've been a FF fan for years.  It really is a must read for anyone who like Dave Grohl/Foo Fighters/Nirvana & rock in general.  So many great anecdotes, amazing right place right time stories. The ups and downs of fame and the music industry, the friends made and lost, all written in a very easy going manner. As you read, you really can hear DG narrating this in your mind, he really is The Storyteller!", "Pleins d'anecdotes d'un grand monsieur du rock", "Todo de este libro es espectacular. No tardó nada en llegar y es el libro perfecto para tardes/noches ligeras, donde uno solo se quiere sumergir en historias alucinantes. En sí, lo único que quizás se nota es que Dave Grohl no se ocupó demasiado de escribirlo, ya que es impoluto. Aun así, sus anécdotas y aportaciones se notan en cada detalle. Simplemente, genial!"]},

Probably a dood time to be Noah Gittell.", "Excellent book for anyone who enjoys baseball and movies. Not only does the author express clear passion and knowledge of the subject, but his insightful storytelling through historical and cultural lenses allows readers to revel in their baseball nostalgia while challenging their perceptions and interpretations of the films. I greatly enjoyed the book and would have finished it sooner but for the interruptions catching up on baseball films!", "Well written, couldn't dispute it's accuracy, definitely covered the 80's and 90's movies (my particular love) very well.", "I love movies but haven't been a huge baseball fan, but that didn't matter - this book is at once both intellectual and entertaining - a fun and intriguing read, punctuated by incredible interviews and stories about the movies and filmmakers. I loved hearing from Richard Linklater, and the backstory on Pride of the Yankees. All stuff I'd never have looked into if I hadn't picked this up, but now will never forget. This is the perfect summer read if you want something stimulating and just really enjoyable and well written.", "I really love baseball and I love movies about it. I was really looking forward to this book and only made it about 50 pages before I gave up. The author seems to forget that movies are made to entertain at the time they are made. They are also “of the time” of their production. So much of his writing takes the (his perceived) shortcomings of the films  to task that you want to just ask him “Yeah, but wasn’t the movie inspiring/entertaining/ fun?”", "He also seems somewhat surprised that the movies of the 40’s and 50’s were not factual. That’s what the biz was like back then. They aren’t documentaries.", "I read the first few chapters, became really almost angry about his dissing of these and his refusal to let go his own social beliefs and see the films as of the time they were made and as commercial enterprises. I then skipped up to his take on “Field of Dreams”(my favorite)  and ended up wondering if the author really even likes most baseball movies at all.", "If you’d like to read my copy it was donated to our local library. It’s maybe the only baseball related book I’ve been unable to finish.", "Like baseball? This is for you? Like movies? This is for you? Like baseball movies? This is really for you!", "Great storytelling by the author himself, with humor and warmth. The choice of a narrator is key to a good audiobook experience. I have stopped many a listen because the voice did not fit the material. Gittell's passion for both film and baseball comes through in a natural, conversant tone, that invites the reader to accompany him on a journey of discovery -- one with fascinating details of films we know well and films we've never seen or even heard of. And it's more than that. We learn how baseball movies both reflect and impact our country, creating an unexpected synergy between Hollywood, the game itself, and American life.", "This is a fantastic book for anyone who loves films or baseball. If you happen to be a fan of both, you're in for a real treat. Noah Gittell's insightful guide made me appreciate the rich history of baseball in cinema and left me wanting even more movies about America's favorite pastime. A must-read for cinephiles and fans of the sport!", "Whether you’re a film fanatic, a baseball junkie or a social historian, you’ll enjoy Noah Gittell’s “Baseball:The Movie”, a chronicle of cinematic hits and misses from “Pride of the Yankees” to “Moneyball”. This is one of those books where you can actually feel the author’s enthusiasm for the subject matter and it is infectious.", "More than just a handy movie guide, the book is both a dissertation and a documentary about baseball movies and the American experience. The author has an engaging writing style despite tackling some serious issues here: post war angst, racism, politics, and feminism to name a few. Mr. Gittell is first a film critic, so he is has a lot to say about certain movies and their merits. I’ll happily revisit “Bingo Long”, “The Natural” and “A League of Their Own”. He also has some thoughts on actors who can actually play the game (Costner and Charlie Sheen) and some witty observations about those who can’t play or were simply miscast (Gary Cooper, Ray Liotta, Wesley Snipes, Anthony Perkins)", "The sweet spot of the book has to be Part III “The Nostalgia Boom”. Not only did the 1980s produce a motherload of baseball cinema, from “8 Men Out” to “Bull Durham”, but also the gold standard of baseball movie stars, Kevin Costner. There’s never been another decade like it. Noah Gittell tells us why.", "Yes, it’s been years since “Moneyball” and as we await the next wave of baseball cinema, the author ends with interesting theories about where the genre should go next and why.", "Finally, there are some cool surprises and fun extras in this book which I won’t give away, except for one thing. The author lists his 10 Top Baseball scenes in non-baseball films. I was crushed not to see “That Touch of Mink” on that list, where Doris Day sits in the 1962 Yankee dugout (yes, those Yankees), berates the ump and gets 3 very famous players thrown out of the game. Cary Grant’s comic timing then hits a home run. Oh well, I guess I’ll wait for it to turn up in “Baseball: The Movie - The Sequel”…."]},

It's a summary of historical events and their impact on women's fashion in France and the United States.", "Each chapter features one or two women and their unique role in creating and shaping the American fashion industry.  Prior to World War II, France was the center of the fashion world, but when war changed everything, the United States gradually moved from imitator to innovator, changing the industry forever.", "The book features several interesting topics including the ways fashion designs were (illegally) copied, the evolving philosophies surrounding women's wardrobes from haute couture to ready-to-wear, and the role of department stores in this transition.  The chapters about women journalists and their role in managing fashion magazines were my favorites - so fascinating.", "The author conducted extensive research for this book.  It didn't feet like an information dump, but there were so many facts, I just let them 'wash' through my mind.  At first, it felt superfluous to focus on fashion in the midst of life-and-death world war events, but I eventually dropped the guilt as I became more invested in the topic.", "Reading this via audiobook narrated by Gail Shalan was definitely the best option for me.  Thank you to Macmillan Audio for access to the audiobook.", "When Paris was taken over by the Nazis in WWII, that famous capital of high fashion began a decline that was filled by American couturiers who had previously relied on the French to lead the way in fashion, no longer only copying their styles and looking to Paris for their inspiration, Starting September 1940, American designers began to shine on their own and by 1945 American fashion began to rival that of France, and New York started to challenge Paris as the capital of high fashion", "This amazing historical novel on the growth and emergence of American fashion shows the rise of \"democratic\" principles in the fashion world - American designers began creating couture for all types of women. Sportswear, ready-to-wear clothes, and mix and match outfits became the new styles for America and signaled a new era of fashion. The first American designers of note are the \"empresses of Seventh Avenue.\"", "This book tells the story of how the Americans could move forward without Paris, for once disregarding the French Legend as the one and only source of haute couture.", "An important book for fashion lovers and for those interested in this aspect of American history, the book details the lives and stories of little remembered designers and couturiers in America who were important to American fashion.  A fascinating book that is well worth reading.", "“Convincing American women that designs that originated in their own country were as legitimate as anything that came from Paris would require a sustained campaign.”", "From the highly polished opulence of King Louis XIV’s Versailles to the gritty streets of the New York garment district, this meticulously researched book pulls back the curtain on the American fashion industry. In this exposé, the tenacity and creativity of a small group of women is pulled from the wings and onto the catwalk. American fashion filled the vacuum created by the Nazi invasion of France and changed the business forever. Unlike other books written about this time period, this one focuses on the war in terms of specific hurdles presented to designers and retailers and how they overcame them.", "Art, design, journalism, finance, politics and marketing all converge, producing a detailed narrative of the drama behind the relationship of Paris couture and USA ready to wear. You will recognize many names, especially some of the titans of the garment world, but here the stars are the unsung heroes; the women behind the monumental shift in the industry. I was particularly fascinated by how the marketing of women’s fashion evolved from pencil sketches to color photography and how incredibly difficult that was.", "I would categorize Ms. MacDonell’s new book as niche non fiction and those who are drawn to fashion in general and under appreciated female forces specifically, will appreciate her fine new work.", "Narrator Gail Shalan manages to dispatch the information with a calm cadence often not present in other non fiction audiobooks and I definitely enjoyed her performance."]},

Shang-Chi came out in the middle of the pandemic in 2021 and wasn't really talked about much, so I didn't even bat an eye at it and had incredibly low expectations. At first it was just another movie to check off the list, but right from the beginning it absolutely blew me away and is now, hands-down, one of my favorite Marvel movies; a true hidden gem.", "After Simu appeared on Jeopardy! and this book was promoted in passing, I decided to buy it. I liked Simu from what I saw from him and wanted to support him, so I figured why not? However, like the Shang-Chi movie, I went in with no expectations...but I ABSOLUTELY LOVED it! I'm someone who usually jumps to the end of the chapter before reading it to see how long it is to mentally prepare myself, but I didn't do that once with this book. I didn't even think to stop. It's seldom I find a book I can't put down—so much that I can't remember the last time it's happened to me—but this was definitely one. The stories of Simu and his parents are humbling and awe-inspiring. The book is also just full of playful humor and references that just make it a good time and makes you laugh—all while showing the struggle of trying to make it in Hollywood — a lifestyle we all glamorize way too much—as well as the struggle that immigrants face. It makes you count your own blessings and appreciate the smaller things in life that you absolutely take for granted.", "The amount of honesty that he lays onto the page as he talks about all aspects of his life is also indescribably appreciated. I know he probably worked with a ghostwriter and editors to write this book but that aside, the words Simu puts onto the page really do seem genuine.", "I love, love, loved the book. Definitely worth the read—and a re-read at that! It's a beautiful story and just made me love Simu even more than I already did. I look forward to his next project, where I will quietly cheering at his side.", "“It seems like such a paradox to me that human beings are both great adapters to change and terrified by it at the same time.”", "I went in expecting a story of his journey to the Marvel Universe and I got so. Much. More. In fact, there was very little on this aspect of his life and it didn’t bother me one bit. Because the story of his upbringing and relationship with his family was so fascinating, heartbreaking, relatable and inspiring at the same time. I teared up more than once.", "At its core it’s a book of acceptance, reconciliation and forgiveness. A beautiful love letter to the family who, for better or worse, shaped him into the incredibly impressive man he is today. What I found to be most interesting is that he doesn’t just tell his own story. He took the time to interview his parents, who immigrated to Canada from China in the early 90’s, about their upbringing and told their stories to help offer an empathetic perspective into what may have caused them to have such high expectations of their son.", "I’d recommend this as a read (or listen because his voice is butter and you can hear quivers of raw emotion when he talks about his family and his dog) regardless of your interest in the MCU.", "💚 🅡🅔🅐🅓 🅘🅕 🅨🅞🅤 🅓🅘🅖:", "-celebrity memoirs", "-Marvel", "-inspiring coming of age stories", "-Chinese culture", "-Picture Us In The Light", "⚠️🅣🅦:", "-abuse", "-troubled family", "This book is really great, and I can't wait to start reading it a second time. I found that I was even more amazed at the life experiences of Simu's parents.", "They were born during the three years of natural disasters, grew up during the Cultural Revolution, took the 1977 college entrance exam, and changed their lives for the first time. Then they gave up their good jobs and lives in Beijing to start from scratch in a foreign country under the wave of emigration in the late 80s and built a middle-class life with their hands. So far, the story is inspiring enough. However, as we know, their son became a Hollywood star, published a book to tell his family story, and became a New York Times Best Seller Author. Even a Hollywood screenwriter could not write such a dramatic life.", "Without the courageous steps of Simu's parents, this book would not exist today.", "What a magnificent life, what a touching spirit of struggle!", "Hats off to Simu's parents!", "--------------------------------", "The book is very informative. Simu tells the story of his parents' struggle from China to Canada, his own journey growing up between the two cultures and his search for his dreams. In the end, he connects all the dots and makes his dreams come true. He is very sincere and honest about his intense conflict with his parents, his anxiety, fear and even despair in the pursuit of his passion. Every first or second generation immigrant can resonate with this book. Most importantly, gain strength from the book. The road is made by people. Simu proves with his actions that anything is possible.", "I am very picky with books I read and it’s hard to keep me entertained but this book just got me hooked after reading a chapter, so I highly recommend reading", "I have always loved Simu Liu on screen but to hear his heartfelt story made me truly look up to him, as an Asian myself. The struggles and hardships he faced are inspirational and one can certainly take away from every celebrity's life story that fame and fortune don't come easy. Thank you for this Simu 🥰", "This book makes me laugh, makes me cry, and most importantly makes me feel at home.", "I admit I bought it because I bought the book because I loved Shang-Chi as a movie. But this book is good (great! Excellent even!) in its own rights. It tells a story about a boy growing up and finding his place in the world. Something we are all familiar with.", "‘An immigrant superhero origin story’", "What a journey.", "Honestly, I applaud him for opening up the way he did. His journey from China to Canada, his turbulent family relationships, to finding his footing, working to defy odds to achieve his dreams, and the road leading to Shang-Chi.", "Simu did not shy away from his relationship with his parents growing up, he has made it known they didn’t have the best relationship growing up and this book gave a real insight and dug deeper into that and his parents own story growing up. But also how far they’ve come now.", "In parts I was smiling, laughing (out loud in public at one point, getting odd looks in the process), cringing, and crying, there were tears (hearing him talk about certain things made it so much more emotional) and just rooting for him the entire time.", "Simu has a way with words, (interviews have already shown a glimpse of this), but reading (and hearing) his own words, written by him, in his own book, just further more shows how articulate he truly is. His words flowed and kept me engaged right from the start. I’ve read other autobios/memoirs and given up because the writing wasn’t great. But not this. I want more. Would love for him to write more in the future.", "Simu really is a superhero; defied and overcame so many odds but isn’t stopping, is just getting started and I can’t wait to see what’s next for him.", "We Were Dreamers is an open, honest, raw, full of heart, emotional, inspiring, at many a times, hilarious, and relatable read.", "(I read the eBook with audiobook, Simu himself narrating)"]},

I found it genuinely hard to put down. Amusing, informative, compelling and - while never salacious or nasty - also honest, informative, often riveting, and (IMHO) a wholly admirable work.

I was fascinated by all the stories of the trials and tribulations of getting the movies done.  What is  also so good is his humanity and his deep appreciation for the work of the actors (Hitchcock famously said that actors were like cattle.\" I don't think Mr. Zwick would agree)and writers who contributed to his work.

Highly recommend!", "How about a book from a starving artist who manages to find his way in TV and eventually movies and starts his directing career with “About Last Night” one of my favorite movies.  Swick gives the inside story of his rise, his issues, his family, but more importantly, this book is about the movie stories and his relationships with big stars.  How about directing Glory with a young Denzel Washington?  What was he like?  Could he see the talent?  Well, they worked together again so I guess that proves mutual respect.  Brad Pitt in “Legends of the Fall”?  Another star early in his career who is a little more difficult to manage as director/actor relationships are not perfect as all actors need different support.

Reading the book I realized that I have several of his movies in my DVD collection, and whenever he had something coming up I was always looking for it.

Basically, we hear a lot about how Commodore Cornelius got his start, which was great, but not how he built an empire. How people make money is important. Was it hard work and smart decisions? What were those decisions? Management style? How did the transition into railroads work? Who were other important people in the businesses? Was he a straight shooter or slimy? Is there a \"great crime\" behind the great fortune? And then, we get to BIlly, his  primary heir, who in eight years *doubled* what was already the country's largest fortune, but *nothing* about how he made that happen (or whether he lucked into it).

This should be mandatory reading for any woman in the film industry, any college student looking to change their major, and any women who is desperately seeking something.

He tells us precisely the first time he used everything and how it felt, and this theme continues throughout the book. I’m not sure if this was done consciously, as a way to help Mark remember how he used to be and keep him sober, or if a former addict in recovery can’t help but frame his life in this manner. There’s plenty of music stuff in here too, but I wish there were more. I learned a few things about Mark’s influences but can’t say I learned a lot more about the band than I already knew, except for two things: 1. Mark wrote a lot of the LOG material I love, and 2. He was high AF when he did. He is far from the only artist who produced their best material while under the influence – Dave Mustaine wrote the best Megadeth records as an addict, and he, too, worried that he might not be as prolific if he got sober. I briefly wondered if I should be pissed that every single time I saw the band (and I saw them a lot) Mark was high and just trying to get through the show so he could score some pills and get drunk and stoned, and decided I shouldn’t. I had a good time, and hey, kudos to Mark for being able to perform fairly complex guitar riffs while being blitzed out of his mind.", "I appreciated him acknowledging his remorse for not being there, emotionally, for his friend Randy during the most difficult time of his life. As any LOG fan can testify, the ordeal surrounding Randy as he waited for his trial in the Czech Republic was trying not just for Randy and the band but for the fans and metal community at large. We all felt that, contributed money to that cause, and worried about the worst that could happen. You can’t change the past, but that regret was appropriate.", "So even though the book didn’t contain as much juicy band and metal stuff as I would have liked, I don’t regret reading it. I’m happy Mark is clean and sober, hope he stays that way, and if writing this book helped in any way, I’m very glad he did.", "I'm not normally one for memoirs from musicians as I prefer listening to their music without peeking behind the curtain. I purchased this book as I was looking for the path to recovery. The stories he told, wrapped in the stuffy blanket of addiction, blunted the severity while still making it apparent just how bad off he was. I found myself going to their albums, listening for the sloppy playing and to find the tell-tale signs of his intoxication. I also dug into some of his musical references, finding myself particularly falling in love with the live Allman Brothers album ge wrote about.", "The prologue drew me in while simultaneously horrifying me as I never realized the extent of his habits. I was also not aware of the death of his daughter Madalyn. It was all so much of a fan-based gut punch but one I needed to keep me reading.", "I am a fan of the band. I am also an alcoholic who is about to hit my first year of sobriety. This book pointed to some areas I need to work on more and refreshed my view of the music thw band puts out. It also gave me a much deeper insight into the mindset of some musicians who share their lives and music with us.", "Cool learning he was from williamsburg va. Cool to learn about lamb of god. I liked reading it. Great read.", "With any memoir, I think it's first important to establish if this is something anyone would enjoy or is it something that is primarily for fans of the author. Mark Morton's Desolation, is more of the latter. I have been a Lamb of God fan for a very long time and requested an ARC as soon as I knew it was a possibility. I enjoyed reading about Mark's history with music and stories from his life that I didn't know before. He is an incredible songwriter and hearing how some of my favorite songs of all time (Descending tops the list) came to be was such a treat. I also think there are some shining, devastating, beautiful chapters that really worked for me and would absolutely resonate with people who aren't necessarily fans of Mark/Lamb of God.", "I think where this really let me down, especially in the first two-thirds was the writing itself. The structure of each chapter starts with a song that is influential to Mark and an anecdote that explains why it's influential. These feel connected to the chapters that follow but sometimes it felt a bit redundant. A few times I thought to myself \"did I already read this?\" but it was because it was because the same story was at the beginning of the chapter. There were other repetitive sentences and themes that took me out of the book a bit.", "Overall, if you're a fan, I think you'll get something out of this but wouldn't necessarily recommend outside of the fan base.", "If you’re a Lamb of God fan, this is a must have! Mark is a great friend and I’ve known him many years. His book is an amazing accomplishment of where he came from to where he is now. Get this book!", "Great book", "A great insight into one of the greatest metal bands. It's also an unblinking look at a long time addict hopefully coming to terms with himself."]},

There's a lot of stuff that hasn't been shared or said before.", "If you're a Wu-Tang fan, this is another 💎 from Lex Diamonds. Get it while you can", "#Reading2022 I just finished From Staircase to Stage: The Story of Raekwon and The Wu Tang Clan by Raekwon The Chef This is a MUST READ! I am a lover of memoirs and biographies they are my favorite reads. The journey to success is important for so many reasons and there is nothing like telling your own story. It is already a well known fact that Raekwon is a genius on the MIC, in the production room, in business and he’s a networking king creating opportunity for his people! I am from Newark, NJ and grew up right along all of the things written in this book. I am a year older than him! I LOVED Wu TANG CLAN day 1 - and Raekwon even before that. I am one of the few from Jersey who used to hang out in Staten Island. One of my girls had a man who lived in ParkHill projects!  (OH MY the FUN) But I digress - Raekwon not only is a lyricist but his storytelling prose in this book is so powerful and good - the pages will keep turning (or like me - those Kindle pages flash by). He is from the streets and worked his way out with a true, focused, clear and determined plan for creating joy, wealth and safety not only for his family and himself; but for his people in the streets. This story is told with honesty, humility, care and wit! Raekwon - THANK YOU for this much needed read! I can’t wait for what’s next and the next book because this man is doing it up! Sending positive vibes and love! Get this book and read it today! #Reading2022 #Book19 (I am really off this year- b/c of so many projects) #Blessed #Thankful", "I really loved this book. It has a bit of everything from true crime, spirituality, brotherhood and manhood. I think it's very inspiring for young folks who may come from similar backgrounds. Raekwon is very open in this book and doesn't sugarcoat much. He seems to be a dope person and real stand up dude which is probably why he has attracted the right people in his life at the right times.", "I recently watched the Wu Tang Saga and decided to read more into them. I almost chose another member's book but then this one popped up and I was immediately sold on it. I'm glad I chose this one to read first. I appreciate that although some relationships are no longer what they were, he gives credit to those people for the things they've done that deserve recognition.  He also reflects on and is honest about some things that he could have done differently.  I think he respectfully shares group issues which is a skill when folks have played with your money.  I respect that despite having a successful solo career Raekwon did participate in some of the group projects that he didn't necessarily believe in to help out those that may not have had as much success.", "This was definitely worth the read.  Wishing Raekwon continued success.", "After reading this book I gained insight to a person and a group to which I had legit never even heard of before. This book tells the story of Raekwon which was a member of a group called The Wu-Tang clan. Beats on his struggles growing up as a fatherless child and the overall struggles as a black child growing up in the ghettos of America. He started off as a drug dealer  but ended up turning to music as his outlet. He spoke of how the group Wu-Tang clan was formed by RZA and how the group spiraled downhill when certain members were given solo albums and other members were not. RZA had  to have all creative control over the group and really make all the decisions and it did not sit well with the group and especially raekwon who was really vocal about his concerns. Raekwon was also upset that the group would not be able to have any input as far as the beats for the songs were concerned and the overall mismanagement that was handled by the group by the founder RZA. RZA also had a brother Divine who was literally mishandling the monies of the group and that also did not sit well with them. I do not want to give this book away because it was really really good and it's really at the top of my list of autobiographies that I have read I will literally definitely recommend this book because it will expose younger readers to the sounds of original Hip Hop and also tell of all the things that were relevant then there are still relevant now. 5/5 stars a definite good book to read", "He is one of my most adored artists so I was so pleased to get this book.  It is an easy read and just a pleasure to get some insight on an performer that I love so much.  You get to see some of the man behind the art.  Love Raekwon.", "Congrats on the book! I loved it! This is the first Wu book I've purchased 🙌 & I haven't been disappointed! This is 🔥!", "First off, I really like the Campbell tartan that Raekwon is sporting in the picture at the end. It strikes close to home, as I have Campbell roots.", "Second, I read a recent article that both Raekwon and RZA were on speaking terms again, which is good. I really possess no power to form opinions on whose “side” I am on, but am at a point where I can take all of this in objectively. I hope to find more books on Wu members and objectively read them. I found out that GZA will be writing a book soon, so I can’t wait for that one to come out.", "I liked reading how Raekwon got his family out of the hood. It’s very admirable that he is providing for his family so that they don’t have to live the horrific life that he lived. I also read that he gives back to many communities, which is so important. I often ask myself what others are doing to make this world a better place. It seems like Raekwon is making this world a better place with his ventures and giving back.", "The Chef is known for his ability to weave intricate tales of the streets into rhymes that have forever changed the palette of Hip Hop.  With this book, he administers the same attention to detail he would with his rhymes and the result is a marvelous book.", "A very honest deep look  of  the life of my favourite member of my favourite rap group the wu tang clan alot of deep stuff about his life growing up and the inner workings of the wi tang clan a must read for any hip hop fan", "A must have for any wu-tang fan or fan of hip hop in general. This whole story is wild from start to finish, from Rae’s early life to the struggles with the Wu, Rae has been through a hell of a life.", "I feel lucky to have been around at an age & time in Hip Hop when 'Only Built for Cuban Linx' dropped to fully appreciate the power of music & what a sound/record can have on one's overall mentality, thought processes, style, persona & general creative thinking...'95 was without doubt the period where artists such as Raekwon elevated the genre to new heights & set the bench mark for artists to follow (but rarely reached).", "So this book came with much anticipation (having read Rae's fellow Wu-member U-God's book, which I found disappointing, meandering & hard to immerse myself in).", "In my opinion Rae's debut (Only Built...) & sophomore record (not officially speaking) with Ghostface Killah (Ironman) are where this book should of started & ended (like most of Rae's later albums unfortunately) as it trails off into a purely dollar chasing, bad blood boiling downward turn (grievences towards Wu management & Rza in particular weigh heavy & the working relationship/creative output of recorded material suffer as a result).", "We get a small insight into the process of making 'Only Built...but not enough to fully absorb the reader in what went into the writing process (the inclusion of lyrics/pictures etc would of been welcomed) & the talent that came through to contribute such as Nas etc (would recommend Prodigy from Mobb Deep's book as a case in point).", "Hopefully when Rae finally releases the story of 'Only Built...in celluloid form, then we will truly understand how & why this record is so important in Hip Hop's DNA. Like Biggie said 'I've got a story to tell' but unfortunately in Raekwon's case it's not as cinematic as his recorded output back in the Summer of 1995.", "Raekwon deserves all his flowers. This book really delves deep into the history of wutang and his life I couldn't put this book down. Its an emotional roller coaster leaving you rooting for the chef. Absolutely amazing book we'll written and authentic. Would recommend to any hip hop head great research material. Word is bond 💯"]},

It is very reaffirming to read of the insecurities & constant battles even a highly successful artist faced/faces. I honestly believe the artistry comes from the intense ability to feel at extreme levels, (the good and bad). While the memoir lives up to its title, it’s not all gloom & doom. It’s a book that speaks plainly & pulls no punches, but it also lets you know that hope exists even in the most hopeless situations. A must-read. Joe Trohman is an excellent writer & hope there is more to come!", "I am a 61 year old, guitar playing, casual fan of Fall out Boy.(been to one concert). I enjoy rock memoirs and this one is great. Trohman is very funny, very honest , and paints a clear picture of who he is and his position in his group and in life. Very entertaining.", "This book was an easy read and definitely gave me new insight into a band that has been a long time favorite of mine", "I don't even know where to begin with how much I just absolutely enjoyed this book, other than I'm just really glad he wrote it and that I'm even more glad he's here. It's nice to read another book from someone who is also a neurodivergent, and it's even nicer to see that their brain works the same way yours does. Joe does a really good job at explaining how anxiety works, and how one thought can connect to another thought, which there in turn connects to another thought that in turns makes someone more anxious. Between that and reading about that whore of a demon known as depression, there was some good things to take away from this book outside of some new music recommendations. You can tell in the writing how, through the help of therapy, he has rewired how his brain deals with depression and all those unbearable thoughts that hurt so many of us. You can see it very clearly in his writing. And to me, that was the biggest take away. Because rewiring our brain is really a hard thing to do. Rewiring those self-deprecating and harmful thoughts into something slightly more positive is hard for a lot of people. But seeing Joe was able to do it, I know that in time I also can.", "So Joe, if you just so happen to be reading this, I just want to say thank you. You are an absolute treasure. And I'm really glad you wrote this. :)", "I've spent the better part of two decades as an avid fan, I guess. A diehard, if you will. Hopefully that won't discredit my sincere appreciation of this work and its author. It's like waiting to listen all this time to a voice you know you needed to hear, but never had the chance. I know I'm (always) late to the party, but I couldn't put this book down. I think that's the beauty of your/& yall's life's work: you speak to those of us who otherwise never found our voices. We could see ourselves through you. And, by talking about mental health, propelling the distigmatization movement that's happening today. I for one had quite a chaotic upbringing, and oftentimes found comfort and happiness with this band that was a constant in my life no matter what happened. It might seem silly, but it's true, it's wild to think back on how much I've grown in this time--and also realize I've been here the whole time. The shows are like coming home. It's beautiful to have read this story and I guess have it all click as to why I've related so hard all these years.", " The world best comes together when we all learn to bare our souls once in a while.", "p.s.

And I appreciate him being honest with the things he likes and he doesn't like (to the review down low asking what does he like) because THATS LIFE, that's how people works.", "Take it as what it is, a memoir, not a book trying to be a pretentious well written story. That's just like a mega blog post of honest opinions and stories.", "So I recommend this book for any fan that wants to empathize with him, to know him as a person, not a rockstar, to know his story and also, as a fan, to know how to behave towards a person that has insecurities and feelings, not just a signing robot 🤖.", "This book brought up feelings in me that I can't even explain, but, in summary, I guess I could say: respect for who Joe is and what he has done. But to be a little egocentric, it also made me feel secure and hopeful. I can't even count how many times I felt seen. It's somehow a wonderful feeling knowning that someone who you admire is as wrecked as you.", "At the same time, it made me respect fall out boy (and admire them and love the songs) even more. I didn't even know that was possible.", "Also, I have to say this is just so well written and constructed, such amazing storytelling, that I felt like I was sucked into his world.", "If you're a fall out boy fan, or overall enjoyer, you have to read this. This is the history of an amazing person, who is far from perfect, and it's Impossible to not feel inspired. He's been one my biggest inspirations for a long time and this book made me admire him more and more.", "So, read it. Not just because of Fall out boy's guitarist, also for the human behind that sick guitar riffles.", "Fall out boy has been my favourite band for many years now, and when I heard Joe was writing a book, I knew I had to pick up a copy. I’m so very glad I did. Between some genuinely interesting anecdotes and deep dives into some personal aspects of his life and the band, it kept me hooked. Joe is an excellent writer, and truly writes from the heart, whether it be those light moments that give you a chuckle, to those moments that are dark and quiet; you could feel the emotion. He has a very clear literary voice and uses it well. Excellent read.", "I didn't expect to love this as much as I did.

The lines of the form vibrate with life as one would find in a loose gesture drawing, the kind the studios look for in assessing the adept skills of a figure or animation artist.  This book captures the same essence of the animation with all the colors and vibrancy found in the film version.  One caveat however, is that the book version is much more saturated darker in the value key.  It seems darker and \"richer\" in the saturation of color and misses some of the softer more delicate nuances found in the animated film version.  Perhaps because of the lack of audio dialogue and actual movement, the publishers decided to go with higher contrast and stronger colors and values.  Also, many of the images are cut in half in closeups.  Perhaps a landscape style book would have worked better instead of a square version since the animation version was wide screen (1:85:1) DVD screen format.  It still reads perfectly well although there are a few spots I would have inserted some pages to make the story hitch together in continuity better.  The text is very unique in a brushpen style and the story does not narrate.  What you get is mostly the quotes in the conversation with the pictures telling the narrative.  If you see the animated film, you will make sense of the story flow in the book.", "It gets five stars for what it is.  The book is strong and nicely bound and the pages are flat with an eggshell finish to them.  The illustrations appear to be in watercolor style, perhaps a mixed media of guasch or acrylic.

Her unprecedented access to the game-changing developers, architects, and investors paints an enthralling saga of ambition, desire, greed, and treachery. The stories don't just drop jaws at the glitz and glamour of the dazzling skyline, but also expose the undulating undercurrents driving such wonders.", "Any New Yorker who has ever wondered about the narratives behind these behemoths of steel and glass, will find this book irresistible. Clarke’s compelling account weaves threads of human drama, over-the-top ambitions, scandal, and the inescapable allure of wealth. Her account straddles the fabric of a gripping novel, yet every account is undeniably real.", "‘Billionaires’ Row’ is a keystone of investigative journalism and masterful storytelling. It provides the readers with an extraordinary journey into a realm often veiled behind the golden curtains of affluence. This book brilliantly transcends niches: whether or not you are interested in real estate or finance or are just an intrigued observer of these modern-day palaces, you'll be pulled into the narrative’s thrilling vortex.", "A highly recommended read. I hope this becomes a Netflix show!", "The book describes the real estate developers who conceived and created the five super-tall (300 meters + / 1000 feet + ) residential condominium towers in Manhattan (New York City) on 57th Street between Park Avenue and Broadway in the early 2000s. It gives the business and personal biographies of the individuals involved and also discusses the financing methods and banks and private equity companies that loaned the developers the money. There are also some interesting comments on New York City zoning regulations. I would give the book 4- or 5- Stars for all that. There is also some name-dropping of famous or at least extremely wealthy individuals who bought units within the towers. There is also quite a lot of discussion of the insane prices being charged — and being paid — for units in these towers and in the New York City ultra-high end tower residences in general in the 2000s. Prices typically ranged  from $3 - 4 million for a small unit to an eye-popping $240 million for a two-story penthouse. A rule of thumb was $4000 to $8000 per square foot ($43 000 to $85 000 per square meter).", "The reason I gave the book a 3-Stars rating is because there is little on the architecture and the interior layouts and decorations of the units themselves. If you are looking for photos and descriptions of what must be opulent residences, this book isn’t it. There are some general descriptions of the sales efforts, the advertising, and descriptions of the building amenities. There are also some descriptions of the architectural design features and the engineering and construction challenges in creating such incredible buildings. There are no photos of the interiors. There are also some titillating descriptions of the divorce lawsuits and financial settlements of a couple of the major developers and their wives.", "Page 337 gives an interesting statistic on the wealth of the world’s uber-rich who can afford to buy such residences: “As of April 2021, … just 2750  billionaires controlled 3.5 percent of the world’s wealth… “", "Enjoyed this journalistic romp through the 2010-20s in prime New York real estate.  Interesting portraits of key players involved in cut throat environment.", "I only rated this as 3 star because I struggled to finish it. I became bored with it about halfway through. Probably shouldn't have bought it, as it's not the kind of thing I'm interested in", "Throughly enjoyable read of a the background to the building of these buildings."]},

I honestly couldn’t put it down and looked forward to continuing it when I had to put it down. I truly enjoyed being in John’s world. The book was vivid, easy to read, light-hearted and kept me interested . It had a very positive bent. I agree with some of the commentary from other readers, such as I thought the Don Rickles chapter was unnecessary. This celebrity doesn’t interest me, but even then, John made the chapter interesting. I also agree that there are some covertly and overly comments related to possible arrogance but they are not very glaring. I got a positive feeling about John after reading his book. It is difficult to judge someone’s personality based what they wrote. He also did make some self-deprecating remarks and admitted some uncomfortable moments in his life, which gave me a more accurate picture of who he could be. In other words, I appreciated the honesty. Good work John. I’m hoping you’ll write others that may delve even deeper into yourself and your work on our favorite shows like ER and Full House. Thanks.", "Just what I expected reading about John Stamos.  Had no problems getting jobs because  of his good looks. But he has insecurities like most of us. Thank you John for letting us see the real you.", "I never watched John Stamos' primary TV show \"Full House\".  Never knew he did Broadway plays.  I was intrigued by his relationship with the Beach Boys who I love.  So why read this book?  Well, he's just there.  Not super famous but definitely a good working actor with what seems like a great attitude in a major part of my life (I'm older).  Did I mention he has women fall all over him?  That's the part I'm jealous of.", "But he's a normal guy with a great, normal, upbringing that falls in to acting with a great soap opera career that starts the ball rolling and is a great part of the book.  And then The Full House with a great group of actors working in tandem which he does a great job describing.  You read many books that talks of the egos but this book focuses more on the positives of his relationships and I think that is the secret to this book and John.  He's a likeable guy who makes the best of his life.  But there is an entire other part that I wasn't aware of: a Broadway career and decently successful at it working along side James Earl Jones among others.  Another great relationship and man he respects.", "A chapter on Don Rickles?  Why not since he knew and spent time with him.  Of course, the hook will be finding Tony Danza in bed with his girlfriend.  But of more interest was his marriage/relationship with model Rebecca Romin Stamos.  Lovely woman which eventually ends in divorce and John owns up to his faults here and how he let this slip away.  (Hey John, I ran in to Rebecca and her new husband on their honeymoon trip in Riviera Maya Mexico.  They seemed very happy).  But can this honest, heartfelt guy eventually find true love?  Of course, that's where the book ends!  Read it.  it's fun.  and I didn't even mention The Beach Boys.  Lucky guy.", "I love John's transparency throughout the book. His ability to be self-deprecating and laugh at himself as he navigates his life's messiness is endearing. I thought he was a handsome man but a bit shallow before I read this. Now I know he's one of the deepest, thought- provoking, humble and grateful men I'll never know but can learn from immensely.  I'm happy he's come full-circle to become that emulation of his parents that he's always wanted to be.  The only parts I wasn't happy with were the name dropping of fellow AA (celebrity and other) members who helped him in his sobriety. As a fellow AA member myself, we don't do that without the expressed permission of those members. That's why it's called Alcoholics \"Anonymous\". Maybe he had permission from some of them but I doubt all of them. Anyhow, good read and sounds like he finally grew up. Good for him!", "I was a big fan of Full House back in the day and love reading memoirs, so of course I bought this the day it came out. I started reading the first chapter and could not get into it for some reason. Didn’t pick it back up again for almost 8 months after finishing another book and not wanting to take a break from reading and did better that time. However, I will say some of the chapters were kind of boring to me, especially about other celebrities that I had no interest in. But I get him wanting to write about people that meant something to him personally. The chapters I liked were the ones about Full House, his childhood, wives/girlfriends and his love for his parents. I’ve always felt like he seemed like a humble and good person and he still seems like a pretty good guy, BUT he still came across as a little full of himself at times which for some reason, I wasn’t expecting. It took me longer to read than it should have (when I actually started reading it for real) which isn’t a good sign, but I’ll say over all it was still worth the read for me. I think it really just depends what interests you share with him and how big a fan you are. If you love Disneyland, The Beach Boys and Don Rickles, this book is for you.", "I have been a fan since the original Full House was on, plus General Hospital, and ER.  He is such a genuine, warm person.  This story has lots of surprises.  This book gives you a warm feeling, he is not a Hollywood guy, very very good read.", "As a girl watching \" Full House\" growing up I always like Jesse ( John Stamos) & his bad boy ways.  He was always the character you loved to hate, but just couldn't.  Reading John Stamos's memoir & how he got into show business was enlightening; as well as; eye opening.  This year inparticular I'm starting to read more memoirs about TV personalities I liked growing up.", "It seems like John Stamos has always been around during my lifetime and looks virtually the same as he did in the 1980's.  Even though I did not watch General Hospital at the time he was on it, playing Blackie Parrish, Stamos's face was plastered on magazine covers and it would have been impossible to miss him if you were a fan of any soap opera.  Then he snagged a new sitcom as Jesse Katsopolis on Full House and almost instantly turned himself into the latest sensation on TV.  After that show ended he had a decent run on ER, playing Tony Gates.  I only saw a handful of those shows but somehow I still knew he was around and doing well in his career.  After reading his memoir, I have a better understanding why he was not just another handsome face.  He is a good actor", " in both life and on TV.  He even did Broadway a few times.  He had a close-knit family whom he loved and who adored him.  His drumming was good enough to play with the Beach Boys on many occasions.  He did charity work involving helping children that he still continues today.  And mostly he had many varied friends from his school days to the present day.  He had a lot of love in his life and eventually, he found the right partner and had a child who, I believe, will be the apple of his Dad's eye for the rest of his life.  Of course,  he fell into a few traps along the way.  Alcohol is one of them.  But his strength of character and willingness to do the work to get sober pulled him through.  He is a pretty good writer too, and the personal notes in the book from his mother were a sweet reminder of how he grew up to become the John Stamos he remains today.", "Pretty surprised to hear such sorrow for John throughout his life. Glad to see he worked through his troubles and was able to share his story.", "Such a real, honest read", "Great read!", "I grew up watching John Stamos on TV so he has 1 million fascinating stories! I want five more new books, please! 💜"]},

It's all Flea, all the time. Flawed, searching, spiritual, goofy, pathetic, disappointing and completely human and relatable.", "Brutally honest.", "You go, Mike.

I will also say I have mad respect for flea and who he is as a person. I enjoyed the book.", "Michael Balzary (aka Flea) brings his authentic, humble, painfully real self to this unusual autobiography. He weaves a wonderfully personal tale of vulnerability, dislocation, and manic energy as he flies through transitions and transformations from Australia to the US East Coast, to LA, and eventually out into the wide world. Despite his onstage persona and the enormity of RHCP on the music scene, Flea seems somewhere between comfortable and wickedly amused at deflating his own ego, and steers away from romanticizing his drug-fueled early days and the birth of his band. He's most beautifully serious and sincere when he talks about the people and music in his life - there's no mistaking his truest loves and where the center of his universe is. Somewhere along the line reading this book, you may realize that you're not reading some formulaic bunch of tell-all \"Rock And Roll!\" BS that may have been written by a ghostwriter. Instead, what you've got is a memoir that reads a lot like an experienced storyteller who's read the works of a lot of great authors and is reaching out, grasping for a connection to the reader through an offbeat narrative in a unique voice. And so it goes.", "I love the way this is written. It reflects  recollections of memories and feels totally honest. I was hooked. I only wish there was a part 2!", "SUCH AN EYE-OPENING BOOK.

Flea’s writing style is as frenetic and inspired as his bass playing. His life story is a wild ride. If you love memoirs, this is for you.", "I usually don't pay a lot of attention to reviews but this book had so many rave reviews I decided to slip it onto my summer reading list. Flea is a good storyteller and a decent writer and the beginning of the book has every indication of that. I tore through the first half of the book only to discover his tiresome and obsessive preoccupation with drugs and self-aggrandizement. Throughout the book, he seems overly focused on appearing as a 'cool guy' and his constant references to some imagined affiliation to Jazz greats (Art Blakey, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie to name a few) is nothing less than annoying. Sorry, Flea, I thought you were a solid player but not in league with the Jazz masters ...", "Flea's account makes it obvious that the Bohemian lifestyle of my generation was very different from what came to be during Flea's time spent in the \"underground\".", "I think there is a trend these days of overindulgent book editors allowing so much superfluous writing to ruin what might have been a good read. I think this book could have told a more effective story with about 200 pages edited out! How many times must we read about every doobie, every shot of coke, pills and what-not smoked, popped, and shot by Flea and his friends? I kept reading in hopes of catching some of the original momentum at the beginning of the book but instead, I was disappointed by what ended up as a series of boring druggie tales. So much bravado so little time ... I recommend it to people who are interested in that period of time in Los Angeles and some of the music that evolved from there, otherwise, as they say here in old New York \"Fuhgeddaboudit!\"", "Flea was born to write.

I have to say this book is absolutely beautiful..  a much more light and positive and sweet story as opposed to the biography of Anthony Kiedis... incredibly well written in my opinion... it kept my attention and I couldn't wait to pick the book up again and again...

It is incredibly informative, meticulously researched, and provides a comprehensive overview of the clown subject matter and their origins. The author’s dedication to research shines through every page, making it a must-read for anyone seeking a deep understanding of the topic. The writing is clear, concise, and makes perfect sense, making it easy for readers to grasp the content. Overall, this book deserves a solid 5-star rating for its exceptional quality and depth of knowledge. I cant wait for the second book!!", "This book is well written, well researched and provides a unique, bespoke insight into the true origins of the clown using historical evidence which proves demonic influence.

Ms. Tysons memoir is interesting and written well.", "My mother in law has really enjoyed this book. She said that she can’t put it down.", "What a treasure for us Ms. Cicely Tyson has been. This book, her sharing her stories with the world, is a tremendous gift. This is a wonderful book for its many stories of industry, family and personalities that shaped the thoughts and actions of Cicely Tyson. Once she embraced who she was and the importance of representing to all the power, grace and dignity of her being, she was always intentional from that point on, about the roles she would accept. She was once offered the role of Christie Love, an offer she found insulting, and it was surprising to think that somehow she wouldn’t mind. For those who are old enough to remember, Get Christie Love, we can relate. And one of the great things about the book, is you will feel the same bit of odd confusion, because what had been shared about her life and career up to that point, leads you to ask, huh?", "“ABC had adapted the story for the small screen in a series to be called Get Christie Love!, featuring a Black female lead. ABC had me in mind to play Christie, Haber explained. The more I read, the lower my heart sank. He must be crazy if he thinks I’m taking part in this foolishness, I thought. Surely there had to be a mistake…….. It’s interesting that when the network heads adapted t he novel to the screen, they reimagined it with a Black woman as basically a prostitute—a narrative in line with the ma ny featured in the Blaxploitation films of that era, not to mention a reinforcement of the very stereotype I’d been attempting, with my choice of roles, to counter. That wasn’t the surprise. The real stunner was that they thought that I—on the heels of having earned every accolade imaginable for portraying the dignified Jane Pittman—would even consider such a role. Between that and the ignorance I’d witnessed while traveling this country to address outright bigotry against Black people, no way was I about to strip down to play a hooker with a badge.”", "It’s a joyous look at a wonderful life lead with purpose and conviction, no great scandalous stories, and even the well-worn stories of abuse from Miles Davis are down played significantly. Miles’ own book has a different story to tell, but Ms. Tyson states she never read the book, “I didn’t need to read a book to know what was true. I lived it. And no written account could fully capture what I know happened between the two of us.”", "Simply, just an all-around great read and her “writing collaborator” Michelle Burford is undoubtedly responsible for the literary flourishes that makes this book sing and soar and Tyson is effusive in her acknowledgment of the talent and “the poetry of the pen” that brings this work to the epitome of excellence.", "Enjoyed reading Cicely Tyson's book. Her history and life story are truly inspiring regardless of your race. Since reading, I have have been watching her famous films which I hadn't seen before. She's a great actress. She chose only films that portrayed the dignity of Black people.  The book is interlaced with Black history. She's a great lady whose family came from Nevis, a Caribbean Island. Lived to 98. Educational  work about theater. Many of her co-stars are mentioned also.", "What an awesome book.  I plan to read it again", "I enjoyed this book.", "Ms. Tysn's life story was interesting.

Excellent advice and what an amazing life!! Grateful that Ms Tyson decided to pen this.", "I totally enjoyed this memoir from Cicely Tyson. I felt as if she was with me sharing her life journey.

Just another bit of entertainment; right?  Well, there might be more to it.  I thought about it and realized this is a lot more than just a fun book. These 101 pages capture what life is like in 2019; at least in most western countries with people of a certain age range.

This book is clearly a labor of love by Mr. Duralde and yet while he is clearly a scholar of film history the book proves to be incredibly accessible to the masses. I found myself engaged as he walks you through the chronology of the LGBTQ+ experience in cinema since the very beginning of the medium. The physical book makes incredible use of images from these films but if you chose the eBook you are going to be in for a treat there as well. Mr. Duralde is the narrator as well so you can sense his enthusiasm and love for the subject as he walks you through. This truly is an enjoyable book and I would encourage just about everyone to pick up a copy!", "This entertaining and informative book provides a deep dive inot the presence of LGBTQ+ folks in Hollywood from the early days of silent films through today. Extremely well researched and thorough. Highly recommend.", "On first impression this looks like a visually stunning, coffee-table book— but it’s so much more than that! Alonso Duralde is a masterful writer and storyteller that has documented and woven the history of LGBTQ cinema throughout the decades. I learned so much about some of my favorite iconic actors and the societal and studio pressures they needed to navigate in order to work. It’s beautifully written, with each chapter showcasing the deep research Duralde has done to bring these important profiles/stories to life. Names are named without being gossipy. It’s a compelling read. Highly recommend.", "Mid-size coffee table book that's well written and entertaining, but also doubles as a reference work. Bite-size chunks of text that can be easily skimmed as interest dictates, but holds together when read as a whole, as well.", "Spans the entire history of cinema, from the silent era to recent hits with color photographs and illustrations throughout, many of which I'd never seen before. Lots of fun trivia and asides. Great for gifting, and an essential addition for any film buff.", "Mr. Duralde is like one of those college teachers that everyone wants and rushes to sign up for his class. I have read his previous two christmas movie books and picked this one up immediately after finding out about its release. He has a way of injecting his excitement about a subject into the pages so that you are not only learning about the subject but educating yourself about important film knowledge. I have only bought the physical book but I am sure the audiobook is wonderful given that Mr. Duralde has done it himself. Please do yourself a favor and go get this book. Then tell your friends to get it. It should be in everyone's home who wants to know about the history between cinema and the LGBTQ+ community.", "This is a great book for anyone who is interested in LGBTQ+ cinema.

Everything in this book was completely fascinating, but also gave a nostalgic feel to take a walk down memory lane of iconic episodes.", "The audiobook is narrated by the author, Brian Moylan. Brian is completely entertaining and engaging. His words are snarky and many times, tongue in cheek. I found myself laughing out loud multiple times, because Brian is hilarious. He knows how to deliver a line and do a killer Housewives impression. I didn't have to speed up the narration too much, which is a first for me (and I loved it).", "This book is perfect for Housewives lovers or those that enjoy Bravo. I've already pre-ordered a physical copy and am sharing it with my mother in law, who also is obsessed with the housewives.", "The Housewives is out May 25.", "Thank you MacMillan Audio for the ALC. All opinions are my own.", "The biggest problem with this book is that it took too long between the idea inception and where we are now because the RH Universe in 2021 looks very very different than it did in 2018 and 2019. First and foremost, Salt Lake City. Secondly,  the Bravo Blood Letting of 2021. It ends anti-climaticly almost musing that it is the end of the era. And yet, in a post covid world, RH is still an entertaining reflection of society in a channel that didn't necessarily pivot, but definitely adjusted to our new world order.", "The first half of the book, which looks briefly at the history and mostly at how things get produced is downright amazing. I have always wondered about the logistics that go into a season, specifically the more complex scenes and trips. ", "In the second half of the book...the author was clearly blacklisted by NBCU at one point. Thus all of his reporting is him attending events or interviewing aggressively academic individuals about nothing. Oh and the chapter on the esoterica of the internet community with RH... I just don't know, it seemed redundant, and like he was trying to meet a page count here.", "That being said 4 stars for giving it the old college try. The writing was approachable and well researched. Just because I found parts of it boring doesn't mean you will. It's like how I hate reading about MFA's during their MFA... the minute things get overly meta, I just tune it out. It's my existentialist issues, not the author's problem.", "There were a few reviews that were annoyed this didn’t have enough juicy tidbits but I really liked it. Because of Bravo’s nondisclosures The author couldn’t interview a lot of people but I felt like it covered so much interesting stuff related to the housewives. I loved hearing about how other fans just like me perceive the show. I loved when he talked about bravocon. The only part that was a little boring was towards the first half of the book when he went through the history of reality TV going way way back, and I got a little bored. But honestly that was the only part I found boring! I just thought it was so interesting and I wish I had more books to read like this. Usually when I read stuff in this genre it’s written by a celebrity who has a ghost writer and it’s honestly just never very good. This author is also just a really good writer and I very much enjoyed this book. He did a great job delving into the psychology of the housewives and the people who love them. Highly recommend!", "Glows: This book was ~pretty~ good. It met my expectations and did reveal some interesting things about production and cast trips. There are a few funny lines.", "Grows: The book is simply not complete in its overview and history of the housewives franchise. Expect to have read some of his \"reveals\" in various blogs and articles over the years from various outlets and sources. Very few housewives were interviewed (a limit imposed on Moylan by Bravo). I understand this is not Moylan's fault but that element definitely felt missing in a book intended to be an expose or \"tell-all.\" The explanation of reality television's allure by the academics towards the end of the book was also far too short and its brevity reveals Moylan's intended audience.", "The best part of the book was about Vicki! ;) The book is worth it just for the chapter about her.", "I guess us Bravomaniacs will have to wait another twenty years to read a true expose that includes many of the women or you could just become friends with some of them and they will tell you, as Moylan explains.", "I don’t know what I was expecting when I sat down with this book, something maybe on par with Most Talkative. To my pleasant surprise, this is much deeper and more comprehensive. Brian clearly is a fan, which makes this book special in that it celebrates the franchise, yet at the same time, provides a very detailed, well researched, look at this global phenomena. As a lifelong student of pop culture (BA/MA in Media Studies), I am both impressed and jealous of his accomplishment.  His analysis in latter chapters is on par with academic journals. My favorite chapters involve BravoCon and his Vacation with Vicki as they provide real insight into the personalities of fans as well as the Bravo machine. Honestly, aside from the food, I would love to hang with Vicki in PVR and I’m not even an OC fan.", "Good to gather more information", "When I heard on the Watch what C podcast that Bravo prohibited any current or former employees from talking to Moylan, I should have known that this book's content was going to be on the thin side. It's too bad, because Moylan is a clever and engaging writer, and how the Housewives sausage gets made must be a fascinating story. Unfortunately we get little of it here, and in its place there's way too much about the audience. The book did make me dislike Bravo, which is surely not its intent. Otherwise, I'm pretty much where I was before I read it.", "This book is a gay mans dream! So be cool, don’t be all like uncool. Pour a glass of skinny girl margarita and bask in your guilty pleasure.

This is a sort of chaotic autobiography, with Bronson taking the reader on a journey from his early days in Queens all the way up to current pandemic times.

Bronson writes about what is was like for him growing up; the people in his neighborhood, and the social environment of being a kid in Queens in the 80's and 90s.  He attributes much of his confidence and thick skin to the environment he grew up in, as he always had to be able to defend himself verbally and learn to be quick with a joke.", "Bronson then goes on to describe various memories and important events in his life.  Bus rides, camps for overweight kids, his crazy teenage years; all played a part in molding his personality.  His chapter about “The Steroid Years” was a little surprising, as he describes the phase of his life where powerlifting was his main focus.  At one point he was leg pressing 1500 pounds, which is pretty impressive, and I never would've guessed he was that strong.  Bronson admits that he trained so hard to lift heavy because it gave him confidence and made him feel like he could be intimidating; until he suffered from a hernia that made him have to change his habits.", "The Chapter titled “F it I'll Start Tomorrow” is mostly about Bronson's battle with his love of food and thinking about dieting or eating more healthy.  This chapter might really resonate for many people, as in the modern Western world many of us have had these same battles with weight loss.  Bronson discusses his ice cream addiction, and his internal mental battles that have plagued him throughout his life.", "There is a chapter about how Bronson's life changed after he broke his leg and had a long period of self-reflection.  He became more focused on his music and making a life for himself, and has been trying to work toward getting things done ever since.  This section of the book in particular does have some inspirational messages, as he advises everyone to find a way to personalize their own  lives, instead of settling for what is presented to you.", "The last chapter of the book was written during pandemic times, and discusses how life has been different for Bronson while living his new quarantine lifestyle.  This book documents an interesting evolution, as in the last chapter of the book Bronson mentions some of the different ways that he has changed since writing the first few chapters of the book.", "All in all I really enjoyed this book.  I think fans of Bronson will not be disappointed at all, but people that are unfamiliar with him should know in advance that it is mostly a messy autobiography of his life; especially his early years, and isn't really intended to be deeply meaningful or convincing.  He is just a man that struggles with the same things that many of us do, but approaches life with a pretty good sense of humor about it all.", "If you're a fan or appreciate Action for who he is you'll like this book.

I had not at the time figured out that I am in control of my emotions. When people poke at you, naturally you would want to react to defend yourself. Now I always ask myself, was that worth it? How do you feel now? I would always feel the same...still mad, and upset...and it would put me in a deeper funk. This book has helped me so much with controlling my emotions. Not everything is worthy of a reaction. I've noticed how much better I felt in choosing joy. This book have a lot of tools to guide you to that happiness. Personal stories you can find relatable, mantras, and more. I am a work in progress, but I can definitely say I've gotten better.

The book is captivating.  Its a tale of two intelligent, competitive men in a complicated relationship.  Book is also funny, enlightening, and thought provoking.  So much more than I envisioned. One of my best reads in several years.", "For a generation of young movie fans in the 80s, Siskel & Ebert (Ebert & Siskel) were perhaps the most trusted adults in our lives. I watched \"At the Movies\" and later, \"Siskel & Ebert\", more religously than perhaps any other show since being weaned off \"The Electric Company\". So deeply etched into my mind are these two that while reading \"Opposable Thumbs\" I could actually hear their voices in my head. Singer's book not only provided a rich history of how the show came to be and how these two became some of the biggest celebrities in film, but reminded me of some of the most instructive and entertaining television I've ever watched. I suspect like many other readers, I spent a lot of time looking up referenced clips of their show and appearances on Letterman and Carson and feeling as drawn to these two men as we were when we were younger. While we see this kind of crosstalk everywhere these days what the modern version lacks—that Singer's book so completely cements—is that Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert were not characters playing it up for the camera, the camera captured who they were and beamed it to all of us.", "I didn’t always agree with Siskel and Ebert. They got things wrong on occasion but they sure were fun to watch and listen to. I do have an issue with the subtitle of the book though. They didn’t change the movies-they changed the way people TALKED about the movies. They changed how we engaged each other about the films we love and hate. Their influence still stands in print and on TV.", "Both men were intelligent, acerbic and traded barbed quips about films so well that one might jot realize that they couldn’t stand each other in the very beginning. Heck, they disliked each other when the first met. It was the competition that did it. Ebert saw Siskel as the rival newspaper’s answer to him and Siskel saw Ebert as a competitor to take down.", "That did change with time. At first, they were a pair of prima donnas; when Roger got a cushion so that he was at the same height as Siskel on screen (it makes it easier to frame the shot), Siskel had to have one, too. The secret weapon behind-the-scenes was Thea Flaum. The co-producer of the show groomed the pair so that their reviews and quips on screen would flow giving them tips,to make their written reviews translate to the screen. She taught them television even goi g so far as to tell them to get a new wardrobe because, as she noted, the way they dressed on screen looked awful. Without Htea, there would be no Siskel & Ebert. The pilot was a disaster but she knew there was something there and helped them hone their television craft. The irony is that neither was a strange to TV but they were to the idea of a two critic show where they had to interact and tolerate each other.", "With time, they developed friendship (and they may have disagreed and dislike each other in the beginning but there was mutual respect. Most of the time) and would stand their intellectual ground with each other. This partnership flourished and it became one of PBS’ most popular programs. Later, when theh left and were syndicated, they continued to be popular.", "This book does a great job covering their childhood, their rivalry, the difficult start of their show, success, the death of Gene Siskel (no how very few knew wbout how truly I’ll he was), the aftermath of the show tin Roger Ebert carrying on with others (though that magic chemistry was gone). It concludes with Roger Elbert’s illness, the show carrying on without him while he recovered and his eventual death.", "There’s a nice appendix of overlooked films that each man championed over the years.", "Siskel & Ebert changed the way that we, as audience members, saw the movies. They were a unique pair, brilliant and challenged each other every step of the way. I don’t believe either man would have it any other way.", "This book did so much for my better understanding of and appreciation for these two brilliant icons. I am not prone to go to movies but I often would only go to see movies that had come under the scrutiny of Roger and Gene. I was in graduate school in NYC 1980-83. With my limited funds I often found myself on the subway seeking out a theater somewhere in the boroughs to see the movies that they had discussed/debated that even in their disagreement would pique my interest so that I had to go see for myself and decide with whom I agreed.  As Singer points out Gene and Roger both loved movies and loved discussing them and were committed to fostering people not only seeing but talking about movies. And no one before or since has done it better.", "Singer also filled out the back stories of the men, the people with whom they worked, the various permutations of \"the program\" and of their personal relationship. I  laughed, cried and \"a-ha'd\" myself giddily through this quick paced and superbly written book - of which the two marvelous writers themselves would assuredly given 2 thumbs up!", "Final thought. This is the first book in two years that was edited and proofed by professionals who care about, spelling, grammar and accuracy in writing.

What I did not expect was how enjoyable it would be to read. Somehow the author manages to provide a fresh, non-judgmental take on modern royal history. Instead of dwelling on low-hanging, scandalous fruit, the book really pulls the common threads from the work of four different royal women to reveal how each uses sartorial skills in her own way. I have been reading royal books all year, and there were even a few tidbits I didn't know (like how William's red uniform was chosen for his 2011 wedding). I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the fashion of royal ladies, and anyone looking to for a new perspective on the soft power wielded by Britain's #1 cultural export.", "I'd never followed royal fashion all that closely before.  I would think \"This is nice\" or \"Meh, I'm not crazy about that.\"  Then Meghan Markle married Prince Harry and everything changed for me.  She brought a style to the royal family that so many people, including me, could relate to.", "After that, I started to pay more attention to royals like Kate and the late Queen and read as much as I could on Diana, who is one of my personal heroes.  I am now a massive fan of Elizabeth Holmes and SMT!  In this book, Holmes chronicles, the evolution of the styles of Queen Elizabeth II, Diana, Princess of Wales, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.  I especially love how she chronicled the modernization of Her Majesty's style at the turn of the century, how fashion helped Diana grow from shy teenager to confident young woman, Kate making bolder fashion choices in recent years, and Meghan wearing brands that promote causes and issues she supports.", "I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about royal fashion.", "I'm finding this read incredibly enjoyable! Packed with photos and all of the insightful and interesting observations, much in the same style as Elizabeth Holmes' Instagram SMT breakdowns are, but she absolutely does have so many thoughts bc she easily filled the pages with new fascinating content! A feast for the eyes and my curious mind. I am delighted by this book, and really appreciate her respectful but honest/factual treatment of all four ladies. Also, not for nothing is it the perfect size and weight to hold. Very satisfying and perfect for gifting.", "HRH is the perfect book to cozy up with for the holidays and at home in the pandemic. I’ve been an avid follower of the author’s for a few years now.. and what started as a fun indulgence has become a passion and has made me rethink the importance of fashion in communicating... not just the fun! Each of the sections are great and there is something fun and interesting for all fans of the royals! Even if you’re just a casual fan it’s impossible not to get excited catching glimpses and stories behind some of their biggest fashion moments. Five stars!!! Gorgeous photos and thoughtful commentaries!!!", "This book would have been perfect with the 3 true royals but adding the fake one detracted from the book. She also definitely has no style even close to the 3 original and legendary British women.", "Not surprisingly, this is undoubtedly the most gorgeous — and the most thoughtful — book I’ve ever owned. And while I knew the photos would be gorgeous and meticulously selected from following the author’s entirely addictive Instagram account {@eholmes} before the book was even announced, I was stunned at the level of detail, the artful storytelling, the depth of insights... I absolutely devoured HRH. And I’m reading it again, now, as a companion piece to a full rewatch of The Crown. I hope this is only Holmes’ first book — it is art and it is amazing. I can’t wait to read it again and again; I can’t wait to give it as a gift {just don’t tell my friends and ruin the surprise!}!

{"BookName": "Willie, Waylon, and the Boys: How Nashville Outsiders Changed Country Music Forever", "Summary": "The tragic and inspiring story of the leaders of Outlaw country and their influence on today’s Alt-County and Americana superstars, tracing a path from Waylon Jennings’ survival on the Day the Music Died through to the Highwaymen and on to the current creative and commercial explosion of Chris Stapleton, Brandi Carlile, Zach Bryan, Jason Isbell, and the Highwomen.", "Category": "Arts & Photography", "BookType": "Hardcover", "ProductionDate": "June 4, 2024", "Authors": "Brian Fairbanks", "HardCoverPrice": "$23.16", "PaperBackPrice": "$15.99", "BookRating": "& ", "TotalUserRatings": "32", "NumberOfPages": "464", "Language": "English", "Reviews": ["This book is not only entertaining and fun, it also goes deep into each man’s psyche and what helped shape them to buck the old country music formula and make their own path to success.", "It also gives an honest view of the country music industry and the influence the Highwaymen still have on today’s alternative country music artists.", "When I first saw the opportunity to review an ARC of Brian Fairbanks' \"Willie, Waylon, and the Boys: How Nashville  Outsiders Changed Country Music Forever\" to be published this Spring by Hachette Books (who graciously provided me with the ARC), my early life growing up with a mom and dad who had, briefly,  run a dance hall in deep South Texas came flooding back to me.  I grew up with photos and stories of many of the people who populate this book, and I couldn't escape the legacy of Country Western Music even if I wanted to (I don't).  The well researched and deep understanding of his material that the writer brings to this work makes it a delight to anyone with even a passing interest in the oversize egos and wild lives that have characterized this genre of music.  The author takes as his starting point, what has been described by one American singer Songwriter as \"The Day the Music Died,\" the plane crash that took the life of Buddy Holly at the height of his powers, and then focuses principally on the careers of Waylon Jennings (who was supposed to be on that plane), Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson from the 1950's into the 21st century.  Along the way he focuses on the oft examined \"Outlaw\" movement and what it meant to the studios in Nashville and the artists they tried to manage and manipulate.  Of course, the author is familiar with many of the other luminaries in this and other genres of music who also played a role in events from Bob Dylan to a variety of rockers and gospel singers.  It is a surprisingly textured and nuanced look at things although I find the later chapters, with their increased emphasis on deeply controversial features of our modern culture, far less interesting, primarily because of the ideological stance of the author, but this in no way negates his accomplishment in examining in depth an important feature of our modern culture much of which is seldom explored in a more than superficial manner.  This book is well worth the read for anyone who ever wondered about what goes on behind the curtains of the music industry.  I have no hesitation in endorsing it; it belongs in every library and on the shelves of many fans who have often wondered about the lives of the men and women who dominate the Country Western genre.", "Reading \"Willie, Waylon and the Boys\" was so much fun.  I read a bit, then I listened a bit to the songs and albums mentioned.  It was a very satisfying and thought provoking way for a music geek like me to spend hot summer days.  It tells the stories of the challenges, successes and setbacks faced by Willie, Waylon, Johnny and Kris as they tried to make it in Nashville Music City. The stories of how the songs and recordings came to be were especially interesting.  I learned a lot and feel more oriented in the context.  And, it was full of ripping good tales.  5 stars!", "The author jumps around and the book never finds a theme. You could probably learn more reading a few Wikipedia articles.", "A very good and fun history of Willie, Waylon and the boys.  Well worth the time.", "I’m not one to write book reviews, but this book so frustrated me, I felt I had no other choice. If you must read this book, please check it out from your local library and save yourself $25. I was drawn to this book because I wanted to read about Willie, Waylon and the “outlaw movement” and what I got was a confusing mess. This book felt clunky, and was at times confusing and did not flow well. The book seemed to suffer from scope creep, where the Author decided to add as much content as he could, information that wasn’t really what the book was about.", "His recounting of historical events sounds like he read a few articles and then inserted them into the manuscript. I’m used to reading historical works, and this doesn’t compare to other historical biographies I’ve previously encountered. There were multiple sentences I had to read several times to understand what the author’s intent was. There were times he bounced from one name to another, and I couldn’t tell whom he was writing about.", "I’m also confused by the inclusion of the later chapters about Alt Country or the Highwomen. This is where I felt the editing let the author down. The title suggests you’re going to get an in-depth look at the outlaw movement from its heyday and instead you get out of left field mentions and random footnotes and a whole section on Jason Isbell and Sturgill Simpson!", "Maybe my expectations were too high, but this was a disappointing effort. Though I’m not familiar with other titles on these artists, I’d bet there are better books out there already covering this subject matter.", "This book is in my wheelhouse.", "I grew up listening to Outlaw Country with my grandparents and getting this inside look at its inception and legacy really hit me with all the feels.", "Brian Fairbanks takes the reader back to before outlaw country was a thing--- to see the motivations and moments that led Waylon, Willie and the boys to take that leap into creating their own brand of content.  From making what could be inside baseball moments with recording studios and producers entertaining to showing us the depths that addiction drove these men to at points in their journey-- the reader gets the full gamut of the ups and downs of changing the music scene.", "I loved getting a closer feel of Waylon and Willie and Kris and Johnny. The anecdotes helped give humanity to the larger than life Highwaymen I grew up listening to on the radio.", "I also really enjoyed the final few chapters. Fairbanks explores their legacy in ways that I hadn't thought about and it helped the book come full circle."]},

He defines the word \"maximalist.\"  Would LOVE to see his apartment!", "I purchased this book IMMEDIATELY after viewing a video clip featuring the homeowner discussing his house. Reading it was an exercise in MANIA without medication! That's not to say the experience was bad, no, no, no -- it was exhilarating--much like the thrill of a caffeine high...

This is a breatakingly beautiful exploration of his personal collection from a maximalist life well lived.  John finds calm in chaos- his entire home is chock full but it all blends together harmoniously.  More than that, it’s a reminder that you can find beauty and joy in all different kinds of things and that family (two and four legged) makes a house a home.

For many Black people across the diaspora, that might be hard to answer because our collective history is full of ancestors being terrorized, killed, maimed, enslav3d and brutalized.  I'm still having a hard time coming up with an answer, although I'm sure those around me will gleefully shout \"Books and Coffee\".  And while that may be true and part of it, the question I think goes a little deeper than that.  One of my favorite things about this book is how no matter what, Joy is defined differently to the individual.  This book is full of wisdom and joyful and beautifully eye-catching  pictures that will surley make you think and more than likely put a smile on your face.

You will be astounded by his attention to detail and even the research that he would have had to do, to put certain things together.

There is barely any dialogue, most of the story unfolds in Stalenhag’s beautiful and chilling artwork….but please pay attention to the artwork because it tells you volumes about what is actually going on.

In my opinion, these components should have been left in but, all in all, one of the best sci-fi/horror books I have recently read….it will definitely make you think twice about putting on  virtual reality headset and also where technology is heading and the devastation it can cause.

So much fascinating behind the scenes peeks and answers to things I've always wondered about. Film is the ultimate collaborative art form. With so many people involved, it's a wonder anything ever gets made at all. Especially the over the top blockbusters that wowed a global generation. While younger readers will likely enjoy this, they won't actually remember when these movies hit the multiplex. But for those of us who lived it, this is an insightful glimpse into how those seminal pictures got made, when and why, and the cultural and historical circumstances that in hindsight make them all the more poignant.  Arnold playing Hamlet? Absurd, right? In Last Action Hero, when he says one of the most iconic lines in history, To be or not to be? Not to be., it seems a mere action genre puff of a cigar to be met with an eye roll. But when you understand the context and that this is Arnold speaking about a generational shift, the ending of an era of movies that made us, one whose ilk we'll likely never see again, this cheesed*** line suddenly becomes heartbreaking in its prescience. Nick de Semlyen illustrates this beautifully,  crafting a book I couldn't put down and lost a lot of sleep while enjoying fully. He's created a textbook for the Action Film genre, one every bit as fascinating as the epics it explores.

The inclusion of Chuck Norris and Jackie Chan (whom I practically worshipped as a teen in the 90s), and Dolph Lundgren especially, felt a little forced or like an afterthought, but for me the book was a real page turner, and I was bummed when I reached the end. 4.5 stars and very much recommended.", "I usually read a little heavier stuff but these movies were the mainstay of my teenage years.

Lost sleep because I didn't want to put it down!", "The first two-thirds of \"The Last Action Heroes\" is fantastic, recounting great stories of Stallone, Schwarzenegger and company as hungry up-and-comers in the action world, with many great anecdotes that focus on Steven Seagal's monstrous ego, however the author, Nick De Semlyen, seems to run out of steam towards the last third of the book and was clearly trying to just get it finished.  The last third, which covers the mid-to-late 90s and recounts the downfall of the muscle-bound action movie stars (Van Damme did a lot of coke) is written with less quotes, feels rushed, and leaves out a lot of historical moments: There is no mention of Schwarzenegger's heart surgery or his appearance as Mr. Freeze in \"Batman and Robin\", both of which were huge turning points in his career which he never recovered from.  De Semlyen doesn't mention the rooftop horse stunt that almost killed Schwarzenegger on the True Lies set, which Schwarzenegger detailed in his own autobiography \"Total Recall\".  Also, when it comes to Jackie Chan, there is no mention of Rush Hour 2, which holds the record for largest domestic box-office opening weekend for any of the action stars covered in this book, which is a major milestone that should have been a significant moment in the telling of Chan's story.  It also would have gone a long way to wrapping up the story in a more satisfying way if De Semlyen obtained fresh quotes from the hunks reflecting on their end of days.", "Also, the Epilogue is plagued with questionable conclusions when it comes to our new era of \"inclusive\" action heroes as replacements for the beefcakes of the 80s and 90s.  De Semlyen mentions Simu Liu, Jason Momoa and Chadwick Boseman as proof that mainstream action has become richer and more diverse, however, in these cases it's the 'franchise' and 'character' that's the star, not the actors themselves.  Kids on the playground will always pretend to be Schwarzenegger, but no kid knows Simi Liu, they know \"Shang Chi\".  It's almost inconceivable that De Semlyen doesn't mention this phenomenon on the caped and masked stars of today versus the Stallone-era heroes: Captain America and Thor can open movies to a large box office, but Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth can not.  Also De Semlyen mentions the movie title \"The Woman King\" as an example of putting new kinds of heroes on the screen, however the author cleverly sidesteps the fact that \"The Woman King\" was not successful, ending its global theatrical run breaking-even financially.  De Semlyen really wanted to make a last-second point about inclusivity, but bringing it up for 1 page in the epilogue without quotes or statistics doesn't make the point he thinks he's trying to make.", "Overall, if you grew up watching Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis and Van Damme on constant repeat like I did then this is definitely a good read, even if the book ends on a whimper instead of a bang.", "This was a fun book and a trip down memory lane.  Didn't want to put this book down or for it to end.  Laughing out loud numerous times.  Recommend this for anyone who grew up in the 80s and 90s who remembers seeing these larger than life action hero on screen.  Some great behind the scenes facts.  Thoroughly researched.  Loved this book.", "O livro é de fato muito informativo e com boas histórias, gostei muito, só fiquei com a sensação de que poderiam facilmente ter se aprofundado na segunda metade dos anos 90 com o mesmo afinco e detalhes como fizeram nos anos 80 e início dos 90, sobretudo destrinchando a curva descendente da bilheteria dos filmes e dos astros, mostrando como cada um lidou com a queda de popularidade e de vendas dos filmes conforme envelheciam e o gosto do público mudava.", "Nada falou sobre os vários filmes de menor repercussão de Stallone após Daylight e Schwarzenegger após Blo flop de Batman.", "Caberiam tranquilamente mais umas 70 páginas cobrindo esse rico período de informações entre 1994 e o início dos anos 2000.", "Livro muito bom divertido, mas claramente acabou antes do que poderia.", "I bought this book for my Arnie/Sly/movie loving brother, on the strength of the reviews. Glad I did because he's very happy with it. I didn't think the cover sold it very well, so I was a bit concerned I was giving one of those 'typical vacuous Christmas gift' books that you chuckle about when you open but have no intention of ever reading.

I wish I could afford to actually see them in the wild, but for now Nat Geo and books like this fill the void. The book gives a quick blurb about the animal's size, habitat, diet, and population status and has a great feel and vintage look to it. The only complaint I have (reason for 4 stars) is that a proceed of the purchase does not go to help protect these beautiful animals. I just find that I'm much more aware these days of the purchases I make and whether or not they contribute to a greater good. That doesn't take away from the beauty of the book though.

It's more than a behind-the-scenes peek; it's a love letter to the show, the creators, the cast, and most importantly, the epic Pam and Angela friendship (which, let's be real, rivals Jim and Pam's any day).", "What makes this book special is the genuine warmth between Jenna and Angela. They write like they're gossiping at Chili's (minus the fire), and their passion for The Office is contagious. One minute you'll be snorting milk through your nose at a hilarious blooper story, the next you'll be misty-eyed over a sweet anecdote.", "This book is a treasure trove for any Office fanatic. It spills the tea on hilarious on-set mishaps, dives deep into iconic episodes, and gives us a glimpse into the magic of creating a legendary sitcom. We get the scoop on how Pam and Angela evolved, behind-the-scenes improv moments, and the real-life friendships between the cast.", "But it's not just about work! Jenna and Angela open up about their pre-Dunder Mifflin days, the Hollywood hustle, and how their on-screen bond blossomed into a beautiful real-life friendship. It's a heartwarming reminder that even amidst paper company shenanigans, true connections can form.", "For the audiobook fans (because who wouldn't want Jenna and Angela narrating your commute?), it's even better!

My daughter is 15 has no boyfriend, but we're already discussing recreating Jim and Pam's wedding when she gets married.", "This book got me in the feels. Not just because I love the show so, so much, but because I get Jenna and Angela's friendship. My best friend came from our years of being active duty Air Force. It's a bond most people just cannot understand. When I listen to Jenna and Angela talk about their friendship, about the ups and downs, about how they can gab for hours, about the intense desire to be together again after The Office ended, I get it. I really, really get it. I cried when they talked about Jenna breaking her back in New York and Angela taking care of her, because when I was pregnant with my fourth child, I started bleeding and was put on bedrest WHILE MY HUSBAND WAS IN ANOTHER STATE. My best friend moved into my house with her 2 year old and took care of my 3 kids, her daughter, and me. She scolded me if I lifted a finger. She did everything. She was amazing in a time when I had no family around and no other options available to me, and SHE suggested. No, not just suggested it, she insisted.", "That was more than a decade ago now and we haven't lived in the same state since 2010. We drifted because life is hard and complicated, but once we came back to each other, we've been closer than ever. She now lives in Florida, I live in Ohio, and we do our best to get together several times a year. We always go to her house for spring break. She always comes here for New Year's Eve (because my birthday is January 3rd). We do a family vacation together as often as we can - with all 7 kids (I have four, she has three). From meeting in Hawaii to meeting in Gatlinburg for Thanksgiving to Disney World and even taking all those crazy kids sailing in the Virgin Islands. Our daughters, who I say have known one another since before they were born because she and I were pregnant at the same time (me with my third, her with her first) are now also best friends and our kids call each other cousins. Our husbands put up with us, but thankfully, like each other as well. More importantly, they understand what this relationship means to us.", "While our families getting together is very important to everyone, we try to do one girls' trip every year because we don't see each other as often as we would like. She's gone with me to book conventions (I'm an introverted author who stresses about marketing herself and she's super out-going, so it helps a lot!), we've traveled back to Charleston, SC where we met (and we got matching tattoos together), we've gone to the Dominican Republic, we've gone to New York and saw three plays in three nights, and we have so many more trips planned. Those weekends are always a tangle of talking, drinking, laughing, and memories, and I savor them.", "Anyway, I say all of this to point out that this book is aptly named. Yes, it's about The Office, but it's about something so much bigger, and I get it on all those levels. When you're part of something amazing, you want the entire world to know.

This read has been a fun, meaningful experience for me and I wish there were more chapters. I didn't want to leave.", "Harvey Fierstein, needless to say, is a sensational storyteller. His book is every bit as entertaining as his parade of plays, musicals, and movies. I have had the great pleasure of meeting Harvey a few times in my long theatrical career. Although he won't recall these passing introductions, they always made a huge impression on me. He was and is a unique talent, whose memoir is as unique and fascinating as the man himself.", "From a traditional Jewish family of modest means in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, Harvey becomes one of the greatest theatrical writers of the day. His parade of hit shows is like a history of gay theatre from the 1970s until this day. TORCH SONG TRILOGY was an utterly ground-breaking endeavor, an epic three-part play about a gay man coming to terms with his life - his search for love, the challenges of keeping love, his demand for respect from his harshly judgmental but oddly loving Jewish mother. This in the 1970s, when such boldly, outspokenly gay heroes were in scarce supply.", "Like any great storyteller, Harvey (everyone calls him Harvey) elides over the sustained trauma. He talks candidly about his battle with alcoholism, but his recovery - poof! (OK, that's a gag.) He *does* seem to recover within a few pages, with little of the drawn-out torture of most alcoholics. He and the famously combative Arthur Laurents have their disagreements, but Harvey seems to cave to the imperious director's demands with no repercussions. And LA CAGE AUX FOLLES is a huge hit, which makes him even more famous and delightfully rich.", "But the backstage peek at the great parade of shows and talent, from Jerry Herman to Stephen Sondheim (who said no to collaborating) to the great director-choreographer Jerry Mitch to Cyndi Lauper, is delicious. Harvey knows everyone - and I mean everyone - in the theatre. He does film and television, but his heart belongs on stage, playing characters larger than life, from Arnold Beckoff in TORCH SONG to Tevye in FIDDLER ON THE ROOF to the unforgettable Edna Turnblad in HAIRSPRAY. The voice, the timing, the drollery - there is no one as funny and bawdy and endearing as Harvey.", "Ditto this enchanting history of his collaborators, his lovers, his co-stars, the backstage people who make everything happen.", "For anyone who loves theatre, this is a Must Read. If you don't love theatre, do I even know you?", "This book is mostly about theatre and a lot about Broadway as told by the diva who lived it. I'm familiar with Harvey since I saw Tidy Endings on HBO in the 80s and of course all of us gay actors in little theatre dreamed of doing Torch Song back when it was edgy and dangerous.", "Harvey is wonderfully chatty, entertaining, and honest. Who knew his circles were so expansive? He name drops not like someone out to impress, but like someone who considered nearly everyone a friend. His stories are told casually as anecdotes and I catch myself pausing to reflect, \"Wait. This person is a megawatt talent, a Broadway icon, a legend. How are they so very real?\"", "And so very wise. Harvey shares quotable observations about life generously because he's done the work, paid the piper, and loves like a bubbe.", "I really enjoyed reading this book.  I knew little of Harvey's work beyond Torch Song Trilogy and Mrs. Doubtfire, but I've always liked him so I bought the book.  I'm glad I did.  This was an interesting read and his sense of humor is great throughout the book.  Boy, did I ever learn a lot about him!  I had no idea just how involved he was behind the scenes with various well-known productions, and all the famous people with whom he has worked.  Who knew!  I would definitely recommend it.", "Fierstein writes with such a captivating pizzazz that you feel his experience.", "I already recommended it to my book club and look forward to discussing it with my friends.", "100% recommended", "Even if I've seen so much of Harvey's work over the years, I was ultimately fairly clueless as to just how much he'd actually done. A very interesting look into  a true insider's POV to the theatre, film and television worlds. Clearly, he's a tremendous juggler with all the balls he can manage to keep in the air. Definitely want to now do a deep dive into what to can to view and/or revisit his roles and writing.", "I've loved Harvey for a very long time.  This was such an amazing and intimate look into his story, full of so many moments and stories and emotional upheavals!! I loved every word.  I'm so glad I read it, and recommend it to everyone with even a vague interest in theater.  Absolutely brilliant.", "It has a few good laughs and gossipy tidbits, but it doesn’t really add up to anything. Fierstein doesn’t seem to have any particular purpose in writing the book. It seems pretty slapdash, like what you’re looking at is the first draft. Strange, since his scripts always have a solid overarching driver. Could have used a stronger editorial hand, and the bad grammar! (Really, Harvey? You and the good folks at Alfred Knopf don’t know the difference between “me” and “I”?!) If you follow theater, you’ve already heard most of these stories. Unless you find it discounted or something, not recommended.", "Everything I thought he might be, he is, and more.  The flow of work through his life and things coming full circle.  Brilliant.", "Il libro è bello, ma era rilegato grossolanamente, con i fogli non tagliati correttamente", "I love this book. I haven't gotten through all of the book yet but it is a great, interesting read. The book quality though is kind of odd. The pages are either not bound correctly or the didn't trim the sides as it isn't even on the sides", "“Scathingly brilliant,” to quote Hayley Mills in The Trouble with Angels. “Amusing and diverting,” to paraphrase Joanna Lumley in Cold Comfort Farm. “Life’s a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death!” to channel Rosalind Russell as Auntie Mame.", "Perhaps I’m focusing rather too much on divas, but Mr Fierstein’s fabulous memoir rather lends itself to such thoughts.

The author addresses problems and solutions for individuals  of all ages.  A great read.", "\"Indistractable\" by Nir Eyal stands out as a pragmatic and insightful guide to reclaiming our focus in an age teeming with distractions. Eyal introduces the concept of \"traction\" — deliberate actions that draw us closer to our life goals — as the antidote to mindless scrolling and the endless ping of notifications. His advice ranges from the practical (send fewer emails to receive fewer) to the philosophical, urging a reevaluation of how we interact with technology so that it serves us, not the other way around. The book's strength lies in its mix of actionable strategies and thought-provoking insights, making it a beacon for anyone seeking to navigate today's digital landscape with intention.", "However, Eyal doesn't shy away from the challenges that come with adopting a more focused lifestyle. He candidly addresses the potential for isolation in our hyper-connected world, reminding us that \"the cost of being able to connect with anyone in the world is that we might not be fully present with the person physically next to us.\" This balance between connectivity and meaningful presence underscores much of Eyal's guidance.", "\"Indistractable\" does more than offer tips for productivity; it delves into the psychology of distraction, providing a roadmap for more fulfilling personal and professional lives. Through a blend of personal anecdotes, research-backed insights, and practical advice, Eyal equips readers with the tools to break free from distraction's grasp. This book is a compelling read for anyone looking to make intentional choices in an increasingly distracting world, earning it a solid 7 out of 10 rating.", "Indistractable was so good I couldn't put it down and finished it in 2 days. It will teach you how and why we can get distracted so easily today. Then, the book teaches you practical solutions on how to be indistractable. These are not just philosophical concepts but real practical things you can do today that will help you in everyday life. I enjoyed how the authors talked about every aspect of life and how to apply the concepts to each area, including work (working from home or an office), family, relationships, friends, children, our relationship with technology, and so on. The data and science that back up these concepts are robust. Lastly, there are a ton of additional resources throughout the book that I am excited to dive into. I highly recommend this book!!", "Being a Product Designer, I really enjoyed Nir's first book, Hooked, as I found it extremely important to understand what it takes to make products people actually want to keep around and make an investment in. Designers naturally need to have a fairly decent amount of psychology, physiology, and the like in order to build empathy for who they are designing for but for as much as understand, we often don't understand the second or third level consequences of our actions or the broader scope of what we build. (On a side note, I believe this is a larger human flaw that is not unique to designers).", "Nonetheless, Hooked provided a lot of the basic habits and factors that go into building habits in order to build great products. Indistractable is about building habits to build a more mindful life. I think both of these books are of massive benefit to those both those who work in technology and those that use technology. It's important to understand how companies build products while it is also important to understand yourself and how you react to certain triggers.", "One final thing I would like to point out is Nir's attention to detail. He really goes the extra mile with his books to help with the retention and execution of the frameworks he outlines. He provides chapter summaries at the key points at the end of each chapter, templates and toolsets you can implement, and even includes some questions that are targeted for book clubs, but can actually make for interesting conversation with others who have also happened to read these books.", "TLDR: This book covers many important facts about human habits and frameworks that anyone can really benefit from.

I was feeling this pressure of distraction while acquiring a new skill within a really short span of time and my struggles with distraction really dampened my spirits.

Well written and a lot of fun to delve into a very different era.", "As a well-written archival study, I give it four-stars. As a reader of less academic works, I give it three-stars. I expected something entirely different from this book which is on me. It is definitely a well-researched study of how women played such a contribution to the success of fashion and thereby Fifth Avenue in that era. I was truly blown away with the lives of the principal women’s lives explored:  Hortense Odlum, Geraldine Stutz,  Dorothy Shaver and her sister Elsie. There were several other women of note and no less impressive in their endeavors.", "Just some random thoughts:", "Interesting to see in many photographs that the executive women had cigarettes sophisticatedly held in their hands. Obviously, a sign of the times;", "Fascinating how differently Hortense accepted her success from the other women;", "With few exceptions, the women improved their respective stores beyond what the men before them had done;", "One thing was clear, no matter how successful these women were, they were paid far less than their male counterparts;", "There were lots of interesting and incidental factoids and pictures; especially enjoyed the gossipy parts the most;", "Coincidentally, these incidental facts sometimes left the narrative with many shifts in content which was distracting. Segue here, segue there…", "There were some quotes of the time that could have been written today they were so “au courant”", "Maxey Jarman, Geraldine’s mentor, “if women are any good, it’s because they are women, not in spite of it”", "Overall, I think this is an excellent source for research into this era, this topic and/or these people. This gave me real insight into a time and place that is fascinating to me while coincidentally feeling foreign. At the same time, in the quote from “The Wall Street Journal” it referred to “dashing through it.” Well, if that meant skipping pages, I concur. Again, this was an interesting book but not one I expected. I volunteered to review an ARC of this book through NetGalley.", "If you are a fan of fashion and the art of retail, this is a terrific historical account of women’s role in the marketing of fashion to the American female consumer.", "Very intrigued by the stories of these women. Came away convinced they all deserve a proper history. Worth the read nonetheless.", "These women re-imagined  how fashion, women, business and manufacturing were changed forever...", "They created thousands of jobs and opportunities ...", "  Engaging and well-written...", "Interesting historical perspective of women taking leadership roles in retail.  But they still were fighting for equal pay.  But they were impacted by cultural norms of the times more than men.  Very interesting book.", "Compelling story well told. Reads like a novel!", "Albeit short time period and small number of women a wonderful description of  vivid time period from WWI o to late 69s", "Importance of fashion and the women who ruled it", "I thought the details about the women were too long.

In this candid and engaging biography, Lee invites readers into the heart and soul of his life, offering a glimpse into the highs and lows of a remarkable career in music.", "The narrative unfolds with a refreshing honesty, painting a vivid picture of Lee's experiences as the driving force behind one of rock's most enduring bands, Rush. From the exhilarating highs of stadium tours to the introspective moments of creative solitude, Lee navigates his musical odyssey with unwavering passion and dedication.", "What truly sets \"My Effin' Life\" apart is Lee's ability to intertwine the story of Rush's rise to stardom with his personal reflections, creating a harmonious blend that resonates with readers. His anecdotes and insights not only celebrate the music but also delve into the challenges and triumphs of a life dedicated to artistic expression.", "Lee's storytelling prowess shines as he delves into the intricacies of his musical genius, offering behind-the-scenes glimpses into the creation of iconic albums and the evolution of his craft. His passion for music reverberates through the pages, captivating readers and offering a profound appreciation for the artistry behind the melodies.", "Moreover, \"My Effin' Life\" is not solely about fame and music; it's a heartfelt exploration of Lee's growth as an individual. His reflections on life lessons, personal struggles, and moments of self-discovery add depth and authenticity to the narrative, making it a relatable and inspiring read for fans and newcomers alike.", "The book's candid nature, coupled with Lee's engaging prose, creates an immersive experience that transports readers through decades of musical history. Whether you're a die-hard Rush aficionado or simply someone intrigued by the life of a music icon, \"My Effin' Life\" is a captivating journey that leaves a lasting impression.", "In essence, Geddy Lee's autobiography is a compelling testament to the power of music, resilience, and the indelible mark of a true artist. \"My Effin' Life\" stands as a must-read memoir that resonates long after the final page.", "While “thoughtful and complex but utterly approachable” can be used to describe Geddy Lee’s imaginative, durable and widely under appreciated band, it also aptly describes his autobiography.", "I do not generally read autobiographies.  They’re a tough medium to love, as they often feel hard to start, self indulgent or self pitying or so deep in the weeds as to lose the reader.", "Not this one. My Effen Life is at times funny and sad, but always interesting and never off key (very on-brand for Geddy Lee). It is a tale extremely well told. The author manages to weave together stories of his lonely and marginalized childhood in an ethnic Jewish enclave on the fringes of the city, son of Holocaust survivors with a raucous rise to fame in rock and roll’s mad early heyday, with the challenges of stardom and persistence. Into this narrative he tells the harrowing story of his families long and painful ordeals during the European genocide, which shaped his parents’ worldview, and ultimately his own.", "There is much for a Rush fan to love in this book. It goes into great detail on the construction of their music, the motivations, drivers and musical tensions involved in every evolution of their music. It delves into technical details about their instruments, studios, stage kit, and light show. In an engaging way, Lee shares the intimate bond between himself, Lifeson and Peart—in the studio, on stage,and on the road, through their many ups and downs. He also introduces you to crew members, friends and family—highlighting their important to the band’s success. It tells a story of a talented, hard working if a bit nerdy and ethereal band who believed in themselves and believed in their fans, which explains the huge almost “underground” fan base that still persists.", "It’s a story of a life still in progress, punctuated by incredible triumphs and unimaginable losses. It is an easy book to read not just because it’s interesting but also because it’s well crafted.  There is much for a non-Rush fan to love in this book, too.", "Though Rush is no more, I suspect most readers will come away expecting more  to come…someday …from its bassist/singer/resident bossypants.", "BTW, read the footnotes. Lee shares awesome nuggets in these stage asides", "When I was 16 years old, a very long time ago, I was invited to go to a concert of a band by which I had only heard one song. I was so happy to have been invited that I went. That band was Rush, and I have been a fan for 44 years. When I saw that Geddy Lee had written this memoir/autobiography I knew I had to pick it up, and I am glad I did. Lee's parents met as teens in a Nazi concentration camp, survived to marry come to Canada and give birth to three children, the oldest of whom was named Gerschon, which was Angelica sized to Gary, which his mother with her accent pronounced Geddy. Chapter three of the book tells the tale of his parents lives and it, alone is worth the price of the book. From there the story of the rise of Rush is told with extreme transparency and honesty as well as humor. This was a band that genuinely loved each other throughout their career. Lee's account of the events surrounding the death of drummer Neil Peart from brain cancer is touching and poignant.", "My Effin' Life is one of the most fascinating books of this type that I've read. It provided me with a lot of insights and more than a few surprises. One of the things I always loved about this band was in a world where so many bands were singing about sex, drugs and rock and roll, these guys were recording songs that were genuinely thought provoking.", "I will admit, I was a little taken aback (maybe surprised is a better word) by all the references to drug use by the members of the band. I know that may sound incredibly naive on my part, but I had always kind of assumed that playing the kind of extremely complex arrangements they created would have required a high degree of sobriety to pul off live. That not withstanding, I consider Rush to among the greatest bands of all time, and this book is a must read for any fan.", "As I was never a huge Rush fan, I did enjoy some of their output. I was more interested in finding out about why this band was held in such high regard...now I know. 3 super talented musicians and the story behind their success all told by Geddy Lee. My Effin' Life is worth a read for anyone even remotely interested in the group's history or music. Well written account of Geddy's life as well as his family's ordeal in the war years which reflects on who Geddy came to be as a person and talented musician. I have read countless Rock bios over the years and this one certainly stands out! Highly recommended!!!", "A perfect book for those looking for a deeper connection with Rush's and Geddy's history.", "Una lectura muy esperada, las memorias de Geddy Lee.", "Libro que todo fan de Rush debe leer. 👌🏽", "Grappig geschreven boek. En bij momenten triest. Menselijk", "Most autobiographies are just that. This is a story. Read it."]},

Very much worth purchasing!", "Bought this book for my class and it has a cute message. My kiddos were able to follow along.", "Bought for a 5th grade classroom and was a great book!", "Great book! Arrived quickly", "Read it at work. Bought it for my kids. Great for teaching them to try new things or things that they don't feel they are good at.", "This is a second copy for our family. We had one before, and it was so well-loved that it fell apart completely. The story line is very simple, but poignant. A great diving board for a discussion with your kids on how their one small mark can make a huge impact on someone else's life. Purchased an extra as a gift for my child's first grade classroom. HIGHLY recommend this book!", "I really enjoyed this short children's book.  I like the premise, the illustrations are fun, the only downside is that I wish the kindle version would allow you to do a \"pinch to zoom\" feature or something.  There are times, especially on a smaller device, where it would be nice to zoom into some of the illustrations to get a better look.  But as far as the book itself, I think it's wonderful!", "I'm an art therapist and my husband is a teacher. We both love using this with the kids we work with for the message and the beautiful illustrations!", "I am a primary school teacher, who planned and delivered a school holiday summer reading club online for young readers. The Dot was my first pick for a session, knowing it was age-appropriate, accessible and has lovely illustrations. It is a great text that gives children a familiar school-based situation about a little girl who thinks she can’t do something. It teaches young readers about the power of perseverance and giving things a go i.e. make a mark and see where it takes you!", "Great book for adults and children alike!", "\"Inténtalo\" es una lección tan simple y muchas veces tan complicada de aplicar. Da igual que no seas el mejor o que directamente seas malo, si no lo intentas nunca mejorarás en nada.

Matthew's book was one that I wanted to read for myself. Though in looking through the reviews now that I have finished it, I realize either someone loves it or does not, there is no in-between it seems.", "Before I write any more of my review - I want to point out that I am 99.9% certain I read a Kindle version that was edited to remove whatever there was about Keanu. So if someone is reading my review wondering why I don't mention it, I cannot comment on what I did not read. --- One more observation, from the reviews I did look through, it seems that most people who *listened* to the book disliked it more than those who *read* it. Seems listening to it make it more difficult to follow the already jumping timeline. Again, just my observation.", "From the beginning Matthew tells us how this story is going to be written/told. How? you ask? \"Groundhog Day\" is his favorite movie, do I really need to say anything more? If you do not understand this reference, please take the time (1 hour and 40 minutes) to watch the 1993 classic movie with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. Then perhaps more things will make sense for you.", "Thankfully I have never been an alcoholic or an addict, however, I have known several in my life. For them every day is groundhog day. Every morning the question of, \"How will I get through today without a drink/pill/smoke/etc.\" makes every 24 hours the same. Matthew shows that in spades with his repetition throughout his story. Many of the reviews I saw complained about the repetition; if they don't understand it, perhaps they should count themselves lucky not to. To have never known someone who lives every day like this; or to not be that person themselves.", "Matthew's story didn't end all sunshine-and-rainbows with a happily every after. Not everyone's does. I appreciated the fact that he kept it real. That he kept it honest. That he shows his faults to us just as much as he shows us the goodness. Life isn't always polished and pretty no matter who you are or how much money you have. Matthew proves that. No matter how bad things seemed to be for him, Matthew always looked to his future, he always wanted to be there. Perhaps not always for the right reasons, but reasons that kept him moving forward nonetheless. There is something to be admired about that.", "Interestingly, one of my favorite lines reads, \"God looked down on me, just waiting it out. He's got all the time in the world. F*<k, he invented time.\" There is something raw and honest and scary and funny in those words that just made me stop reading and literally highlight it in my Kindle book. Follow that with another line I highlighted that reads, \"It was an amazing moment and a terrible moment all at at the same time.\" Talk about defining life most days. Perhaps not Pulitzer winning writing, but powerful and truthful just the same.", "I have to say my all-time favorite sentence is this one - \"God is everywhere - you just have to clear your channel, or you'll miss it.\" Doesn't matter what version of God you believe in, that sentence has a profound truth to it. (That one got highlighted in pink) Not something I would have expected from Matthew. But I am grateful he wrote it.", "I am easily giving this book all five stars for it's raw honesty, it's openness, it's imperfectness. Just like Matthew.", "Yes, I finally read his story after his sudden death on October 28, 2023. As I'm writing this on November 24, 2023, his cause of death still has not been determined nor released. Which makes one last sentence stand out for me in a premonition kind of way as I wonder what COD will turn out to be... Matthew himself wrote, \"I could have a cigarette right now, have a heart attack, and if no one was around to call 911, I was a goner.\" Well, he was home alone, and he did try to call 911 himself, but he was unable to save himself this time. Oh, Matthew.", "I wonder if you have finally found peace and all the deep, full Love you have always desired. Thank You for leaving a light on for us with your story. I pray it helps more people so that you may continue helping people even after you've gone on ahead of us in death.", "If you’re going through struggles as Matthew did, this book will be relatable and could possibly change your life. Very funny and brutally honest. Will be reading again", "In a nutshell, Matthew Perry’s book, “Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing” courageously invites readers into his life, explaining his struggles of love, loneliness, and addiction.", "Let me preface my review by saying, I am a huge Matthew Perry/Chandler Bing/FRIENDS fan.", "To my surprise, Matthew was noticeably different from the rest of the cast during the FRIENDS reunion. When he announced his upcoming book, I made a mental note to purchase the book and put it in queue to read at some point. When the news hit of his passing citing ‘cause of death unknown/under investigation’ my curiosity peaked.", "Which brings me to my review…", "Matthew Perry delivered a book illustrating what it was like struggling with mental health and addiction. He shares his childhood trauma, which inevitably left him lonely with a constant longing for a loving/fulfilling relationship. I understood where he was coming from and how at the end of it all (even while having it all) he still felt empty. He went through a series of rollercoaster rides with repeated relapses and failed relationships, not to mention the millions of money spent in search for a permanent state of sobriety.", "There are criticisms on the repetitiveness within his book, in which I highly disagree. The reality is that  he was a person struggling with addiction. I found the repetitiveness to be, quite frankly, honest as most addicts fight daily inner battles: some relapse and some don’t. For Matthew Perry, his truth is that he did relapse several times. You can’t help but expect his story to be repetitive. I personally believe his memoir to be courageous, open and honest. I found no trouble with chronologically following his life’s events as others have. To me it was an easy, yet heartbreaking read.", "It’s easy to judge and think how could someone as accomplished as Matthew Perry find himself in this kind of predicament?  But on the outside looking in, we will never know what someone is going through. This was his story to tell", "I liked this book because it was a quick, easy read. The chapters were written as the late Matthew Perry sounded in cadence.  I appreciated that it had an entire glimpse and first-hand perspective as to who he was and what he was dealing with as far as the layers of his addictions. Perry was raw about it.  He told truths about abandonment and addiction that showed a direct correlation in his life.  He shares quotes and thoughts that will leave you feeling validated and seen but also with compassion and an understanding of addiction as the disease it is today and what it was to him. Mr Perry captured what it was like to seek drugs, alcohol, or all of it, and to relapse multiple times. He shared what it was like to hide the addiction and to lose love over it as well.  This book is quippy and honest, with a touch of reality and grit.  It's inspiring and beautiful work that should be shared with those struggling or that have overcome addiction, or abandonment. It's splendidly written, and it is a shame we lost him. This book is a beautiful reminder of the late Matthew Perry's truths.", "Reading this book, and knowing that he is gone, almost feels like he is talking from the grave. So sad. He had such potential. He tries to not blame his parents, but to no avail. They were self-centered individuals, and essentially abandoned him almost from birth. He made attempts to save himself, but in the end, he couldn't. Heartbreaking.", "Loved every bit of it.", "Hes a wonderful writer and has a great sense of humor.", "Great history there.", "Como una de las millones de fans de Friends y Chandler, puedo decir que este ha sido un libro que me ha acercado mucho más a una persona que sentía conocer de toda la vida; pero que, conozco realmente por primera vez. Conocer su perspectiva de la vida, la fama y las adicciones, sin duda ayuda a entender lo que pasa por la mente de las personas que parecen tenerlo todo pero “se pierden”. Con una narración sincera y emotiva, Matthew nos cuenta su gran vida y su gran revelación.", "Uma leitura necessária.", "Ler o memoir de Matthew foi uma oportunidade de conhecer, de forma crua e verdadeira, a mente e as emoções de alguém que teve que lidar com a depressão e o vício durante toda sua vida. Uma narrativa conduzida por uma pessoa mundialmente conhecida, mas superficialmente interpretada. Alguém que viveu processos de análise e terapia tão complexos e profundos que propõe um auto-conhecimento humano que deveria ser difundido em todos.", "It was a great gift for a friend", "I am extremely satisfied with my purchase . The product arrived quickly and exceeded my expectations. Highly recommand this seller"]},

You can’t help but respect his loyalty to his bandmates and his appreciation for where he is now. Maybe hearing about the racism he had to battle along the way will open some people’s eyes about what goes on daily in this country.

I thought this was a well written book and I learned I had a lot in common with Darius as far as our love for and how we view music.  I didn't know much about Darius the person before reading this and unfortunately he comes off completely full of himself.  Many stories will leave you rolling your eyes as they are likely exaggerated if true at all(You're no Todd Snider, Ruck).  In between the lines, it sounds like he admits he wasn't well liked among many.", "As others have noted, most of the book goes from his childhood through the Cracked Rear View tour, and then jumps really quickly to his C&W career and leaves out many details about his wife and children as if they are afterthoughts.", "All in all, its a good read about his youth and early Hootie days.  Take his stories with a grain of salt and you'll have fun reading it.", "Loved this memoir!

Highly recommend!", "I have been a Hootie and the Blowfish fan from the time Hold My Hand came on the radio. These guys are my Beatles (though I love The Beatles, too), so I had to read Darius's book Life's Too Short. It was well-written, like he was talking to you over breakfast at the Waffle House. Darius gives us a look at his life before Hootie as well as life on the road and recording and everything in between. I had read Jim (Soni) Sonefeld's book as well, so I wasn't surprised by the drug use, just by the extent. They never had any legal issues (until recently, anyway) with drugs, so didn't hear about it.

It's nice to know he still enjoys that passion and enjoys working and creating.

It assumes that Darth knew Luke and Leia were his children, that Han, Chewie and the rest of the characters lived nearby and were friends, etc. You need to know about the Star Wars films for the books to be funny, but they really are. This title is one of the best in the series.  I bought this book for a baby because her father is a huge Star Wars fan, and I know he will enjoy reading it to her for many years.", "I grew up, loving Star Wars, and I’m hoping to pass that along to my daughter. I thought this would be a fun book that she can keep and hopefully relate to as she grows up. All of the comics in this book are really funny because they are relatable and I can definitely see these situations happening between my husband and my daughter. Hopefully it can bring light to some difficult situations she will have growing up.", "Love all these books but this was our favorite!", "My almost 2-year old daughter really enjoys having this book read to her.  Unlike ", ", which just has Luke as a young child, this covers Leia growing up from a child to a teenager.  Because of this some of the pages are beyond my daughter's understanding of humor and are definitely aimed more at the parent.  However since I end up describing many of the scenes to her I can still tailor the pages to her interest or skip past the page entirely if it's boring to her since there are plenty of other pages to read.  The drawing style is very cute and includes plenty of little details and characters in the background that you will notice new things each time you read the book if you look.", "This book is a fun take on what it might have been like for Darth Vader to raise his daughter and captures the same everyday situations the rest of us have been in, just with a galactic twist.  A fun read, whether or not you read it to your child.", "This book is pretty good, but Vader and Son is better. I think it just made me expect more for this one. It still has some Star Wars references, nice drawings, funny moments, but it feels shorter, and I wasn't as fond of the preteen rebelious Leia jokes-- maybe because I dont have a preteen yet? Maybe I'll like it more when my daughter is older.", "This is the perfect gift for a Star Wars (SW) lover and his daughter. It's cute with references that the father will get but the child will enjoy. I found this book while browsing through amazon, but I originally saw the author's work through Reddit. The author is active in the community and his comics have always had that slightly sarcastic and playful tone that I think all ages can enjoy.", "While the book is clearly not representative of the true father-daughter relationship these two had, there are plenty of humanizing moments that really make you connect to the characters in the book, and might even teach a valuable lesson in parenting (or two).", "If you or someone you know is really into SW (and especially if they have a daughter), I'd recommend this book. It's really lighthearted and fun for anyone and everyone familiar with the series.", "This is very much like the Darth Vader and Son book.  Same artwork and witty humor.  This book centers around Princess Lea from a young girl through her teen years, not just as a little girl.  Very cute for any parent that is also a star wars fan.  If you aren't a  Star Wars fan you probably won't get a lot of it though since other character like Han Solo are represented during the \"dating\" phase :)", "If you need to get a happy present for someone, a gift under a price limit, someone who's kids are going off to college!!!!!  or have a new parent in your life, this is a GREAT gift to have them laughing at and remembering the little things they went through while raising their daughter.

I couldn’t put the book down!!!  It was an informational and great read!!  I highly recommend it.", "I didn't know this book existed until the day after he passed. Ive been an unwavering fan since the early 80's and was devestated. I have to tell you that this was one AMAZING read! It's an honest and soulful look into the man behind the voice that could have melted Mother Teresa's panties off. The writing really captured his devilish wild side, kindness and wit. Throughout the mayhem,subtances, health challanges, grief & pain this man endured, he gifted us with the most incredible music this side of heaven. He rocked us until the end. This book is such a wonderful tribute.", "Interesting biography of the life of Jack Russell, best known as the lead singer of the rock band Great White. The author made it a very easy read. Not boring it all. I finished it quickly. I liked the interviews with friends, acquaintances, former bandmates, etc. It provided an interesting view into the subject's life. I felt all types of emotions while reading this book. I liked him, I admired him, I loathed him, I felt sorry for him, and not necessarily in that order. I paid a little bit more for the pre-order, but that's ok. I knew it going in and I enjoyed reading the book. Well worth the read...in my opinion.", "The beginning really grabbed me. Thought I knew about the rock and roll scene but I guess not. I remember the Station night club fire and heard it was the band’s fault but after reading about what really happened it made me angry that this talented and really good natured guy took the rap. Great read and the interviews at the end were terrific", "Overall, I did enjoy this book. And the stories jumped around just enough to keep my a.d.d. like attention span interested. The part I found to be disappointing was the lack of editing. It's like this book was never proof read before it was printed. The amount of typos, broken sentences, and repeated sentences were all throughout the book. And I found that to be distracting at times. Hopefully they do a revised version and fix that at some point. And the hype about the final words. Yet no mention who actually wrote them?", "I'm still glad I read it aside from the editorial misses. Rest in Peace Jack Russell.", "Excellent and very well written.

I hope this comedic genius isn't going to sell out for fame and fortune, but we'll always have Fleabag, clearly the best comedy series of the last decade.

There are plenty of those out there, and if that's all you're wanting (or willing) to engage, go read one of those.", "If, however, you are interested in an exploration not only of George Jones and Tammy Wynette, two of the greatest voices (and most tragic figures) to have emerged from the landscape of 20th century music, irrespective of genre, but ALSO of the cultural developments within western civilization that functioned as the sociocultural \"primordial ooze\" of the worlds that birthed their respective ways-of-being - which is to say, the context within which Jones and Wynette existed - then I can say, with a remarkably high measure of confidence, that you will NEVER encounter a finer tome on the subject.", "It is, however, not told in a straightforward, cookie-cutter manner. You'll be disappointed if you buy this expecting it to be one of those biographies that gets churned out en masse, following a simple \"Birth & Childhood > Early Career > Heights of Success > Career Decline & Later Years > Death & Legacy\"-type template. There's nothing wrong with that model; done well, it can be quite efficient as a vehicle for covering necessary details and broad strokes of a life with an economy of words and pages. But author Tyler Mahan Coe determined - rightfully so, I would submit - that the lives of Jones and Wynette, and the details of their lives which must be discussed, are far too multifaceted to be adequately covered in one of those standard color-by-number jobs, precisely BECAUSE these lives are far too complex and complicated to be understood by readers who don't have at least a conversational knowledge of the many disparate sociocultural threads that shaped them.", "Why spend time on matters such as bullfighting, moonshining, and medieval jousting (among many, many others) in a book about two famous country music artists? Because, for those paying attention, there are throughlines that serve to directly link 16th century European political and religious conflict, 19th century Spanish matadors, and early 20th century Appalachian manufacturers of illicit corn whiskey to the world of country music circa the mid-to-late 20th century, where our subjects lived, worked, struggled, suffered, and ultimately made their mark on the world.", "This is not a book for someone who wants to learn the essential details as quickly as possible and move on. This is a book for those who want to savor the ecstasies and experience the agonies of Jones's and Wynette's music and lives within the broader context of the world that shaped them. If that sounds like a good time, this is a must-read.", "I rarely give up on a book, but I could not continue with Cocaine and Rhinestones. As others have noted, the book is filled with irrelevant information, which is discussed at length. Owen Bradley compares music to ice cream? Let's delve into the history of refrigeration, which made the mass production of ice cream possible. The chapter beginning with an account of bullfighting did it for me. I never did learn much about George or Tammy.", "Tyler Mahan Coe does an amazing job of setting the tone for this heartbreaking story. The author gives a thorough background of the people and places this story comes from rich with real life detail and does a great job of informing the audience that this work can be enhanced by supplementing it with various audio resources and songs. Much like the podcast that this work is descended from the author’s appreciation of country music as an art form and love of it as entertainment shines through. If you are a George jones fan I definitely recommend giving this one a read! The author does a great job of making jones a sympathetic character while not covering up the harsher realities of the person he was. Ditto with Tammy. She is presented in a fair and understanding light while also acknowledging the selfishness and other less than desirable tendencies people will choose to overlook in icons. All in all a well told story and well written book. Give it a read if you have any interest in country music, love or American celebrity. Great job Mr Coe can’t wait to read the next one!", "The illustrations are scary and you cover everything about country living before you even get to George. Do you ever get to George and Tammy?  I gave up after quite a few chapters.  I did learn a lot about moonshine and vinal records tho.", "I am listener to his Cocaine and Rhinestones Podcast, so I was definitely happy to buy and read this.", "This not a traditional biography and it contains interludes that include everything from Medieval history, moonshine, bullfighting and the Nashville Studio system in the 1950s through 1970s. All of these things add to set the scene of the story. As the book is adapted from his podcast, written as if you are being told a story, rather than what would may expect from a more traditional writing style.", "The story is a tragedy. It will rip your guts out.", "It's also immersive and damn difficult to walk away from. Many may find the interlude chapters off putting, but I personally do not. The twists and turns keep me intrigued. If you don't want to be challenged by what you're reading, this book is not for you. But if you want to get immersed in a story of American music stars that will challenge and wreck you, this is the book.", "PADDED with useless chapters about world history. (?) The Medicis?

This isn't just a book; it's an odyssey that delves deep into the human psyche, exploring the lengths people will go for love and obsession.", "The narrative is as exquisitely crafted as the artworks it chronicles. The author masterfully weaves together multiple storylines, shedding light on the often shadowy underworld of art theft, where fortunes change hands in the blink of an eye and trust is as rare as a genuine Rembrandt. The characters are intricate and multi-dimensional, transcending the typical archetypes of criminals and victims. The interplay of their motivations – from love to greed, ambition to revenge – paints a vivid picture of humanity in all its flawed beauty.", "The love story at the heart of this saga is as mesmerizing as any of the stolen masterpieces. It reminds us that beneath the veneer of crime lies a tale as old as time: the pursuit of connection and understanding. It's a poignant reminder that love, in all its forms, can drive us to extremes, both noble and nefarious.", "The pacing is impeccable. Each chapter brings with it a new revelation, a twist, or a deeper insight, making it nigh impossible to put down. The balance between the meticulous details of the art world and the raw emotions of the characters is nothing short of masterful.", "But beyond the captivating story and the poetic prose, \"The Art Thief\" also raises profound questions about the value we place on art and the lengths we'll go to possess it. Is it the monetary value that drives this obsession, or is it something deeper, more primal? The book challenges us to reflect on the role of art in our lives and the price we're willing to pay for beauty.", "In conclusion, \"The Art Thief: A True Story of Love, Crime, and a Dangerous Obsession\" is a tour de force, a masterpiece in its own right. It's a tale that lingers long after the final page, urging us to look beyond the surface and find the stories hidden in the shadows.

I read this book in one day because it was so fascinating. The writing made me feel I was there when he took the art, and if it was fiction, I would say no way could they get away with that. Museums are places I love to visit when we travel, and I can see wanting quiet and space to appreciate the pieces. But I have trouble making the jump to him, thinking he should just take them. Great book.", "This book was amusing and shocking all at the same time.  People that steal art objects are not a singular group of people - motives are as varied as the people that steal them.  This particular thief, having a truly selfish love of the objects, was particularly entertaining and extremely well read and informed about his thefts.  And he was innovative and adept at his thievery skills.  It was also a game to steal and a challenge.  The author, getting information straight from the thief himself, made the story even more intriguing.  This book is very entertaining read.", "It was well written and reseached...amazing insanity on all the participants.", "I purchased this book from Amazon based on their recommendation. The author wrote the book with narrative through out that explains what happened after arrests are made. I believe Mr. Finkel did an excellent job leading the reader into Breitwieser's gradual lust for stealing art. I really can't imagine how he ever thought this would end of well. Then again, I don't think he really cared. Personally, I believe he had a thirst for the excitement of stealing and since he loved/studied art why not. Breitwieser had worked for a short time as a security guard at a small museum and learned security or good security is not affordable for these size museums. He of course took full advantage of this knowledge.", "After a bit, one theft became many and the reader may get a little fatigued reading about all of them. The detail is amazing on each theft.  It seems Breitwieser has a fantastic memory with one description relayed by the author as him telling about each screw being removed to obtain a piece of art. So as I'm starting to think about skipping a few paragraphs, my attention is completely swept up by his capture. The story takes many an interesting twist and turn which had my full attention.", "All in all a very entertaining book. Buy it!", "Intriguing, educational, and sad all at the same time.  I don’t usually go for non-fiction but this book has me hooked.", "The topic of art heists is fascinating, but I found the last third of it disturbing.", "I greatly enjoyed reading this book, so well researched and prepared over a decade of fact finding and interviews.  The author tried to remain neutral despite the shocking and repulsive behavior of the characters in the book.", "It is the story of a very spoiled, selfish, narcissist enabled by his mother, maternal grandparents, and girlfriend.  His mother and girlfriend were complicit in his actions. No moral compass until caught by law enforcement, but even then the thief seemed arrogant and expressed no regret!", "This story is compelling in that it shows what greed resides in a person's soul and there's no remorse, no consequences, no mind what the cost in the destruction of valuable art artifacts, no matter who it affects.

Definitely worth checking out.", "I’m grateful that he shared his incredible story.", "So well written. On of the best memoirs by a comic. Richards was a foundational member of the greatest sitcom ever produced. The behind-the-scenes is fascinating, and his whole life and preparation leading up to the breakthrough defining role is worth reading. Seinfeld writes an Introduction that alone validates the purchase price. Finally, Richard’s’ philosophy, drawings, and photos make this a well-rounded and intriguing read.

Thanks for sharing your life and Kramer with us!", "Like most of the other reviewers, I enjoyed the parts about his acting career and especially his role as Kramer in Seinfeld. He also does a nice job explaining the Laugh Factory incident which effectively destroyed his show business career. Michael comes across as a likable and interesting guy. The problem with the book is that it needs focus…it is all over the place. He intersperses his pseudo-philosophy throughout and it comes off as a bit bizarre. A good editor would have reeled this in since it isn’t what readers are interested about. As with most celebrities, we enjoy their characters and find their real selves to be less interesting. The book could be cut in half if they remove the asides.", "It was a gift for my husband, he loved it. Interesting and humorous!", "This book is not written by Kramer if that's what you were hoping for. It's written by Michael Richards who is nothing like Kramer. He's an actor that plays a very different person than who he actually is. He's a very spiritual guy, very deep into theater and writes in a non-conventiinal way.  If you want to get to know Michael, the actor and here a few stories about Seinfeld too, then I'd recommend this book. If your expecting something from Kramer, then pass on it.", "This was hard to put down. As a longtime Seinfeld fan I especially enjoyed learning how the character of Kramer was constructed, and how different Richards is. The spiritual side was interesting as well, and I look forward to something more explicit. But for Seinfeld fans, this is a must-read.", "I have long been a fan of Michael’s.  I think he’s an incredible talent.  And also, a decent human being.  I really enjoyed reading about his early life, much of which, I had no idea about.  I also have huge appreciation for just how much work he put into making ‘Kramer’ one of the most loved characters on TV.  He made it look so easy, which is testament to his dedication & talent.

I am so happy to read all about you I think the world missed you your writing your style everything you do, you touched the hearts of so many people laughter saves peoples lives, I love your book amazing  and writing !!", "If you're expecting a day-by-day autobiography, you'll be disappointed.  If you want to find out about Michael Richards, warts and all, his outlook and philosophy on life, dive straight in.  Yes, of course you get rich details and tidbits about his time on Seinfeld (the greatest TV comedy of ALL time), but you also get to understand the man behind it all, the man behind the comedy mask.

This bio, drawn from significant research and interviews with multiple sources, presents CBK as a smart, vivacious, happy, savvy woman who had a strong career in the fashion business - rapidly rising at Calvin Klein which was no small feat - and many friends long before JFK Jr arrived in her life.", "Oddly, the book offers as much of a look at JFK Jr as it does CBK. His friends - many of whom considered CBK to be \"non-prep school, non-Ivy\" - saw her as a threat to their proximity to John & were the source of many of the vicious, cruel, lies that were spread about her. Really? Did they think he was never going to grow beyond the cool college guy into a 39 yr old whose wife would be more important to him than they were?", "The paparazzi hounded her until she became reclusive yet she was criticized for not working after marriage. She couldn't leave the apt because paps were positioned there 24/7. Her experience w/them is described as something close to trauma & her husband seemed to not understand it even though his mother was notable for getting a restraining order against 1 particular aggressive pap. CBK is pushed against an elevator by a mob of them & her husband does nothing. Much was made of her low dose antidepressants that washed up on a beach after the crash - sounds perfectly natural for someone to seek psych help after years of being hunted.", "It's not until p. 238 that one of John's friends is quoted as saying what I'd begun to think - why isn't he at least moving her to a building w/a doorman? hiring security? Why is a couple whose celebrity has become so enormous so quickly without professional management for business & social purposes? John's magazine was launched just as the internet starting the decline in paper magazines why not push re-set with business management? John seems completely out of touch w/reality when he claims that his mom raised her kids in NYC so why is CBK reluctant to get pregnant w/JFK III? He totally ignores that John's mother lived in the White House when he was a toddler and then married Onassis to raise her kids on a private island in Greece to get away from the publicity following his father's assassination. She wasn't pushing a stroller alone in the narrow streets of Tribeca!", "The author gives a balanced account of the marriage to the extent that any outsider could. They died before they'd been married 4 years so there were adjustments to be made & given that they were both Catholic wouldn't have taken divorce - if it was ever mentioned - lightly.", "It's a good and credible read.", "I only partially understand the negative reviews of this book. It could use improving. The author does include her own conjecture too often (but she makes it clear when she's doing this - it's not like she's deliberately mixing fact with hidden fictions). There is also repetition among some of the points she makes.", "That said, I have no idea why some reviewers say there's \"nothing new\" in this book.", "I've read every book about Jackie, Jackie & JFK, Jackie & Lee, JFK Jr., and JFK Jr. and Carolyn published in the last 35-40 years.", "There's a whole lot of new information in this book. The author left no stone un-turned in tracking down those who knew Carolyn and were willing to talk about her.", "She's amassed input from all kinds of people that none of us have ever heard from before. Further, it's not the author's fault that a whole lot of the compliments people give Carolyn are similar (which can make the text seem repetitive).", "There were dozens of people who knew Carolyn and remember her with tremendous affection. They agree she was smart, hard working, highly intuitive about and compassionate towards the needs of others, generous, fun, and uniquely beautiful.", "When all kinds of people called up from her past are saying the same thing, I tend to believe it.", "The author does mention some of Carolyn's character weaknesses and failings - but she tries to explain them away, which is why some people think it's a book about \"Saint Carolyn.\" That's a mistake on the author's part. Yet, having read a lot about Carolyn in the past 2.5 decades (much of which is suspect, and seems wildly unfair to her reputation), I can understand the author's desire to counteract what seem to be false narratives.", "Regarding the insights of the overall book, there are 7-8 things this author has tracked down regarding the very beginning and middle of Carolyn and JFK Jr.’s dating relationship that I have NEVER heard before (two in particular left my jaw on the ground).", "Carole Radziwill's book mentions they dated intensely for a bit, broke up (this book tells us why) then got together at a later point.", "This book gives way more insights. After parting ways (dramatically!) the first time, they got back together, sort-of, again (interspersed with him returning several times to Daryl Hannah) - then only several years after all that did they become exclusive.", "This book also has A LOT of interesting detail, also previously unrevealed, about her career at Calvin Klein (not to mention her childhood, teen, and college years).", "It also paints a likeable, and admirable, picture of Carolyn's mother, Ann.", "I'd like to thank the author for the hard work she put into this. No book is perfect, and she's certainly contributed to Carolyn's memory in what I think is a truthful, and sorely needed, way.", "We are given a glimpse into her life, successes, fears, achievements, comedic side , empathy, and unique connection to people. We get a chance to know the real Carolyn. Not what the media has lead us to believe about her life. It is a tragic story of an individual who like Jackie Kennedy valued and treasured her privacy yet was hounded day after day. John could have done so much more to help her navigate being his wife. A very nice read.", "I enjoyed reading the book and have read some of the others so I already knew a lot of the information. It was a quick read and thank you for writing it.", "Great book. Always considered her fascinating despite not much being written about her. This book helps answer a lot of questions and clears up a lot of the lies written about her. Highly recommend.", "Great book!", "Really enjoyed reading this book.Very informative about Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and did a great job of highlighting her internal and external beauty.Reading it will only enrich your life X", "Despite some reviewers protesting about the book being a bit too benevolent, all the previous accounts about Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, an extremely accomplished trailblazer woman were surrounded by sexist toxicity. It was about time some writer, in this case Eizabeth Beller is unrivaled, expounded another different side of this fashion icon, a young woman who had daddy issues and mood swings, she was a perfectionist and she could be stubborn, she became increasingly paranoid due to her harrassment by a voyeuristic press, but guess what? She was actually a nice woman who in the early 90s stumbled upon the beloved John Kennedy Jr and she fell in love with him (not the public persona, his real self). Beller summes it up best: \"The assumptions were from the pictures that she was icy, that she was cold. What I quickly learned was that she was warm and effervescent. She was joyful and loved to laugh.” A splendid biography totally worth your time. Highly recommended.", "I enjoyed reading about Carolyn Bessette’s life", "There was so much media attention to her relationship with JFK Jr that the public didn’t really know her as a person", "The book has lots of details about her generosity of spirit and fashion sense.", "There’s some details about the plane crash and the tragic aftermath", "Truly a life cut too short.", "Unfortunately I tried to return the book and order it again for 2 times, but always received the same error on pages.

Of Romani/Gypsy ancestry, my Gran started me on sketching my own deck at age 8 using woodchips scattered on the cellar floor from her husband’s woodworking. I continued it until marriage and later made another deck after menopause, but neither one invoked the necessary bonding I am still seeking in my old age.  I will add that the Romani had what my Gran called the Drom Ek Romani (Way of One Gypsy) cards/wood chips centuries before the decks became popular during the Renaissance, but that is an oral tradition with no proof. I believe Katy Hays brilliantly tapped into the feelings upon discovering the deck that seems to reveal the secrets of life.  And, anyone who has ever tried to break into academic life with a mere B.A. degree from a not-quite-right university would have to love the book and cheer on the main character, also portrayed in a wonderful way by Katy Hays.  However, it has always been difficult for me to like a book if we discover that certain characters are morally flawed beyond our own standards, but I will not indulge in spoilers.  The book is also special because it somehow morphs into a psychological thriller and a mystery and I found that to be a treat on so many levels.  A five-star read, for me.", "“What if our whole life—how we live and die—has already been decided for us?”", "So this book gave off the creepy ominous vibes pretty early on and I was in love. I always find that I enjoy the academia type stories more than I anticipated and this one having tarot cards as the focus was really cool. I think what I enjoyed most about this one was that even though it had this supernatural element... the motivations were all so normal. Ambition, love, betrayal, power, envy, anger all of them played a crucial role of the story and the unfolding of events. Ann is very much motivated by her desire to be an academic and Rachel becomes someone she clings to and trusts because of the power she radiates.", "Ann is very skeptical of the importance that Patrick places on the tarot cards at first but I love how we gradually see her perception shift, almost to fit her motives. The book really highlights the stark contrast between the idea of fate and choice and I loved the way it did. I have to say that at times the book felt like it was dragging just a bit and I really wanted some action to happen. I was a little disappointed that the tarot cards weren't providing a bit more of an occult element but like I can forgive it because of the way things played out.", "The book really saved all its shock for the end. I have to admit that I didn't see the ending coming and I truly loved the shock reveals we got. I enjoyed all the ways that ambition and obsession played out in this story. I love that it kept the creepy vibes going the whole time but I feel like some elements could have been explored a bit more. Overall though it was a really good read and now I am on the search for more stories with tarot cards at the center.", "As I live a few blocks from the Cloisters, am a member there (via the Met), and visit there often, I try my best to read anything that uses the Cloisters as a setting.  Somewhat surprisingly, this is actually the second novel I’ve read with the Cloisters as a key setting.  Unfortunately, this novel is not nearly as engaging as James Carroll’s The Cloister.", "In this novel, a young woman named Ann Stilwell comes from Washington to NYC with a degree in art and a summer job at the Met.  On the verge of losing her job on day 1, she is scooped up by Patrick Roland, the curator of the Cloisters and begins working there.  She becomes friends with associate curator Rachel Mondray and gardener Leo Bitburg.  The art historians are working on a exhibition of tarot cards, and become enamored of the idea that divination with the cards is quite possible.", "There are some good things here.  There is the interesting fish-out-of-water experience of Ann trying to fit in with the artsy culture of NYC.  The relationships Ann develops with Leo and, especially, Rachel are engaging in certain aspects.  Also, unlike a number of novels I’ve read lately, this novel finishes strong, with some surprising, yet not outrageous, revelations.", "The main word that comes to me when I think of this novel, however, is vague.  This is its major problem.  I was unhappy with her descriptions of the Cloisters.  Despite knowing the place well, I couldn’t picture the spaces she was trying to describe.  And was she restricted from naming the artwork on display there?  The pieces she describes could be found in any museum and the Unicorn tapestries, which are the Cloisters most famous holdings, don’t even rate a mention.  Worse, the movement towards a belief in the power of the tarot is almost completely undeveloped.  There was nothing in the characterizations here that actually made me believe that the characters believed.", "In the end, this book was a disappointment.  I got the feeling that Ms. Hays had maybe visited the Cloisters once or twice but never got to know the place well.  Her descriptions of the neighborhood in which I live lacked any kind of precision that would give the novel a feeling of place.  Though the story is a fair one, there’s nothing about it that makes me think the Cloisters was where this novel had to take place.", "This book is not the same old, same old kind of mystery. It starts slow and builds steadily, however, as the main character evolves the plot takes twists and turns that are refreshingly different. I learned a tremendous amount during my reading journey, which is also—for me—the mark of a well written book. The characters are not typical, and if you don't have to feel like you'd like to be best friends with the main character in order to like a book, this may be a good choice for you. The setting is atmospheric, the characters are unique, and the plot is unusual. I enjoyed the book very much and if you like that which is different, yet still creative, well written, and entertaining . . . I highly recommend this book!", "Having quite recently visited the Cloisters for the first time, I was drawn to this novel.  It did prove to be a rewarding read, although I found the ending puzzling. I particularly enjoyed the emphasis on the Tarot, a subject I have recently become enamored of. The characters were well-described and the plot caught my interest throughout. As the story reached its climax, I feared a conventional movie-type ending, but was pleasantly surprised. I anticipate Hays’ next novel.", "Muito bem escrito", "I really enjoyed the majority of the book which focused on the casting of fates, the different ways in which various religions and civilisations looked at divining the future and the history of tarot. What surprised me was the direction the book quite quickly took in its latter stages. Won't go into detail to avoid spoilers, but I found it quite unnecessary and would have been happier if the original concept had been adhered to as I felt that story still had plenty to give. Have to say I found the final set of revelations were akin to a plot from a struggling soap opera. Still, prior to the end, I thought the book was well written, characterisations were good and descriptions of the Cloisters brought the place alive", "Slow chapters aside, a perfect read.", "Libro arrivato perfettamente, copertina meravigliosa, l'unica differenza rispetto a quanto visto in foto (ed è per questo che gli ho dato 4 stelle invece di 5) è la mancanza del/dei segnalibri visto/i nelle foto di presentazione del prodotto.

Through relatable anecdotes, practical advice, and profound wisdom, the book guides readers on a journey of self-discovery and liberation from mental, emotional, and spiritual bondage.", "2. **Clear and Engaging Writing:** Written in a clear and engaging style, the book captivates readers from start to finish, making complex concepts accessible and applicable to everyday life. The author's authentic voice and heartfelt messages resonate with readers, inspiring them to embark on their own paths to freedom and fulfillment.", "3. **Practical Strategies:** \"Becoming Free Indeed\" provides practical strategies and actionable steps for overcoming obstacles, breaking free from limiting beliefs, and embracing a life of purpose and authenticity. Readers will find valuable tools and exercises to apply in their own lives, empowering them to create positive change and manifest their deepest desires.", "4. **Spiritual Guidance:** Rooted in spiritual principles and biblical teachings, \"Becoming Free Indeed\" offers profound spiritual guidance for those seeking deeper meaning and connection in their lives. The book encourages readers to cultivate faith, trust, and surrender as they embark on their journey towards true freedom and wholeness.", "**Cons:**", "1. **Religious Focus:** While the spiritual perspective of \"Becoming Free Indeed\" may resonate with some readers, others may find the heavy emphasis on religious themes and biblical references to be limiting or exclusionary, especially those from different faith backgrounds or belief systems.", "2. **Lack of Diversity:** The book may lack diversity in perspectives and experiences, potentially alienating readers who do not see themselves represented in the narratives or examples provided. A more inclusive approach that acknowledges a wider range of identities and backgrounds could enhance the book's relevance and appeal to a broader audience.", "3. **Overly Prescriptive:** Some readers may find certain sections of \"Becoming Free Indeed\" to be overly prescriptive or formulaic in their approach to personal growth and transformation. While the book offers valuable guidance, individual journeys to freedom and fulfillment may vary, and a more flexible and open-ended approach could accommodate diverse paths to self-discovery.", "4. **Limited Depth:** Despite its valuable insights and practical advice, \"Becoming Free Indeed\" may lack the depth and complexity found in more comprehensive self-help or spiritual growth books. Readers seeking a deeper exploration of specific topics or concepts may find themselves craving more detailed analysis and exploration beyond the book's surface-level discussions.", "Overall, \"Becoming Free Indeed\" offers valuable guidance and inspiration for those seeking personal freedom, spiritual growth, and fulfillment. While it may have limitations in terms of its religious focus, lack of diversity, and prescriptive approach, its empowering content and practical strategies make it a valuable resource for anyone on a journey of self-discovery and transformation.", "This is truly a good read for anyone struggling with faith or fear because of past religious experiences. This book sheds light on what true faith is.", "There's a lot of talk floating around these days about Christians who are deconstructing their faith. These are Christians whom the church has wounded deeply, hurt so badly and let down so hard, they feel they can't get back up again. For many of these Christians, the church, which was supposed to be a sanctuary, has been a place of nothing but emotional, spiritual, and often physical and sexual, abuse.", "I am not that Christian. If anything, all the \"noise\" about deconstruction, false teachers (it seems every time I turn around, somebody who was once trusted is being accused of false teaching), and false doctrine, breaks my heart. I did not grow up with teachers like Bill Gothard (thank the good Lord)! My parents and family were nothing like the Duggars, and my life was not a fishbowl. Yet I have been attracted to stories like Jinger Duggar Vuolo's for years and continue to be attracted to them. Why, and among all the stories, was Jinger's any better or different?", "I'll answer those questions out of order. First, yes, Jinger's story is better and different. Second, my \"why\" is a little different from your average \"deconstructing\" Christian, but it is in their neighborhood. That is, I have not deconstructed, but chose Jinger's story because I identified with her. In a world and Christian subculture where so many are stripping faith down to the studs and leaving Jesus behind in the junk pile, I want and choose to stay true to Him. But how to do that amid all the construction noise? Because let me tell you, construction noise, literal and figurative, can get on your last blessed nerve!", "Jinger Duggar Vuolo gets that, and she wrote that story in the most honest and refreshing voice I've heard in the 2020s narrative about deconstruction and disentanglement so far. Refreshingly, she doesn't use Becoming Free Indeed to bash her parents and family, or even Bill Gothard (though he would darn well deserve it)! As she says, Becoming Free Indeed is not a tell-all. It's not scandalous.", "Instead, Jinger is gentle yet up front about the realities of her life and her faith. I could sense the dilemma that occurred in my own life--her family did what they thought right, she loves them, she embraced Jesus--but yet, that experience, and Jinger's personality and personal bent, led to a lot of anxiety and fear. Jinger knew her Bible in the way many Christian kids, including yours truly, grow up knowing it. We learn it through Bible stories and \"sword drills\" and Bible trivia (man, I used to *clean up* at that; still can). We were told to read it because it pleased God (subtext: not to read and love the Bible is to make God upset). But we (I) don't *know* the Bible like we should. Jinger knew God as Heavenly Father, but like yours truly, that was more like, \"Daddy loves you, but also, don't mess up or there'll be trouble when Daddy gets home.\"", "So yeah, Jinger and I were not \"abused\" as such, or living in abject fear, but I empathized with her and applauded her honesty and straightforward yet gentle presentation. She challenged me, but without saying, \"It's your fault for falling for this stuff\" or even, \"How could you believe what I did, you didn't grow up under Gothard\" (because I admit, I sometimes felt guilty reading this book, since I *didn't* grow up that way and thought, \"Why do I feel the way I feel?\") The message I got from Becoming Free Indeed is not, \"Christians are totally messed up and brainwashed,\" which is what the world's culture wants to tell us and where deconstruction comes from. I think Jinger and Christians like her are getting it right, in that Christians have a valid belief in *Jesus,* we've just let all this other junk get in the way.", "I do have a couple mild to moderate critiques. The first is more a question on my part, and again, this is Jinger's book, not mine. So however she chose to deal with this is fine with me. But throughout the book, I found myself responding to Gothard's teachings thus: \"Excuse you?\" \"Where do you *get* this stuff?\" \"Um, you WHAT, now?\" And yet, Jinger never questions the fact that her parents, and especially her family's little ones, still follow this man on any level. I understand she can't force them to change their belief system, and in terms of the adults, that's on them. But as much as I loved the fact that Becoming Free Indeed is not a tell-all, there were areas where I kind of wished Jinger had come down a little harder and said, \"This man is false, he is dangerous, not just because of what he's been charged with but because of but because of what his ministry does in the everyday. I still love my family but struggle with their involvement,\" or something.", "My actual critique comes from the fact that I wish I knew a bit more about Jinger's disentanglement and how it affects how she interacts with culture today. That is, like her, there are ways I interact with culture that are not specified either way in the Bible, but that I can still feel guilty or anxious over based on what other Christians do or don't do. For instance, I have been in prayer circle with older ladies who, if they knew I listened to Hamilton, Newsies, and Six: The Musical, would probably have coronaries. I have, as an adult, read, relished, and found Christian messages in Harry Potter. I disagree with Christians who have banished Disney wholesale from their homes. I am a disabled and autistic woman who wants to speak of systemic ablesim but hesitates to do so for fear of being accused of being \"woke\" (same for systemic racism, by the way). I disagree with corporal punishment even though 90% of my fellow Christians claim it's biblical and that my disagreement is mild to moderate rebellion in and of itself.", "Okay, so you get it. My point is, Jinger does give a few examples like this, and I appreciate those (yes, I confess, I have a pixie cut and I wear pants to church. I can't even remember the last time I wore a dress, period). But within our culture, I feel like a lot of those examples are kind of...is the word \"obvious?\" I wish she had gone into some more \"current\" or controversial examples, like the Disney thing or the corporal punishment thing. And yes, even more controversial doctrines--and I think we all know what I mean. Because the Bible is clear on those, but they may not be \"essential doctrines,\" and are they the hills Christians want to die on? (As in, yes, I will 100% accept persecution for believing Jesus is the only way to Heaven and is the Son of God, but some of this other stuff? Am I willing to risk it? Not sure).", "Anyway, that's the long way to say, I don't have critiques as much as I do questions. I wish Jinger and I could just grab some tea or coffee and talk some more (and as far as social anxiety, I get it. Don't worry girl, I got you). But in the absence of that, Becoming Free Indeed is still well worth the read. I dare say it will in some way refresh your soul.", "I got this for a book club and it wasn't what I was looking for.  Although, her story is good, I didn't connect with her at times.", "If you saw the Duggars when they were kids, you need to read this. It doesn't bash the parents, just the views of how they were raised. Jinger does a great job bringing to light how they really are and what they should be really teaching", "Thank you my sister in Christ.", "I strongly resonated with what you said about your social anxiety and the pain of leaving everything you once believed behind.", "So much of this book reminded me of myself and my journey.", "God bless you and your family.", "Love you Sister 💕", "As a preacher I found the honesty and journey to be so truthful and accurate. Jesus is everything we will ever need for all time he is our friend.", "Jinger has exposed a cult like group with grace and truth. I pray this book will be helpful for others seeking to disentangle themselves from man-made systems.", "This book was mostly just different bible verses with Jinger explaining what Gothard had interpreted them to mean compared to what she now \"knows\" they really mean. I feel like Jinger has left one cult & is now in a slightly less strict cult. Apart from a few small anecdotes about her life there wasn't much of interest, it was just her interpretation of what she now believes.  (Or has been told to believe.)", "I’m giving this book 4 stars because I found it to be well written and it was a very easy read. I found the courage inspirational and I always love hearing other people’s stories. My only negative on this book was that it was verrrrrrry religious oriented. I expected this getting into the book, but there were times it almost came across preachy. Otherwise I really enjoyed it."]},

The challenges on those shows were like the World Series to me.", "Nowadays far more people are horrified and revolted by the despicable dishonesty of the convicted felon he is today and will be forever more.

'After I lost the election...,' Trump says. These words come tumbling from his mouth, almost against his will, and he winces in surprise.

Hats off to this author, well written.", "By grounding his portrayal of Trump in his role as a reality TV star, Setoodah nails something Trump's other chroniclers have missed: Trump is *still* a reality TV star—one who now, in summer of 2024, is angling to get renewed for another season.", "With the exception of a few passages where he gets lost in the weeds of \"splits\" of money between this revenue stream vs. that one, who was running which network and why—topics only of interest to Hollywood insiders who obsessively follow the news in Variety—Setoodah is a good writer. He observes Trump keenly and has a knack for capturing telling details.", "This book gives you a look at Trump from a new perspective.  We all watched The Apprentice.  We all have said “You’re Fired” at one point.  We have bought the ties and didn’t plan dinners for Thursdays.  Then he became President.  He took his role on The Apprentice and expanded it.  He understands ratings and the overall appeal of having different characters, the good looking one, the villain, etc.  Somehow, he bumbled all that together and created a character half the country loves.  Did he ruin the country? Did he create division? Did he set back human rights 50 years? Has he made the US unsafe for minorities and LGBTQ? Has he kidnapped the American flag and the term “patriot” to the point half the country doesn’t even want to celebrate the 4th of July or wear a shirt with the flag on it in fear of being thought a Trumper?  Does it matter?  He’s looking for fame.  He’s looking for season 2.  He doesn’t care what it takes.  He’s in character and half the country thinks he’s the answer.  God save us.", "Reading now...enjoyable", "Cute cover and premise.  But the story is as disjointed as a Variety Magazine article full of irrelevant characters from the TV show that are hard to care about.  Edit this down to 20 pages, and it would work better.", "Well written and an educational piece of information on Trump and how his made for tv program enhanced his disorderly personality. Excellent read.", "I can only imagine what the author went through writing this book. And yet it was often amusing and completely credible. I usually do not spend this much on a book however, I saw the author discussing the book multiple times on MSNBC and knew he was going to tell a honest story about someone we think we know very well. I was also drawn in in regards to the time Trump was on The Apprentice. It was a good show for the first few years. Trump came across as a smart and yes at times a compassionate business man. It is unbelievably jarring how someone can present as someone who seems kind and decent and eventually exposes to literally the world exactly who he really is. The book is worth reading because the author has managed to encapsulates this man Trump so very well."]},

The book covers 5 chapters - palette, texture, form, layers and nostalgia.  Josh describes how he uses each of these elements in his design and in making a home.  The photos take us through each of Josh's properties and are very well done.", "I enjoyed the book quite a bit.  My only disappointment was that I had thought Josh was an interior designer working for other clients, in addition to being an artist, and I would have liked more variety - such as seeing other client's homes as well.  Putting that aside, it is a very nice book!", "I am a long time follower of Josh's. I was so excited to order his first book but to finally get it and sit with it, paging through his talent was something so very special. The Artful Home is a wonderful view of Josh's amazing and truly timeless talent and approach to art and design.", "His work is so elegant and blends both classic and modern artistic interior design style that I love so much.", "I was drawn in by his personal touch on the stories that provided an intimate background to only make me feel connected to him even more. Congratulations Josh, very well done !!", "I anticipated this book’s release for months and it did not disappoint. Josh’s designs are some of my favorite - always so perfectly collected and intentional. Every single page in Artful Home is a feast for the eyes and Josh’s story is touching and beautifully written. On top of the endless inspiration within, the cover is a work art in itself.", "To expensive, not great quality.. wouldn't recommend it.", "This book is absolutely beautiful. Josh Young has an incredible eye, classic but comfortable. Highly recommend this book to everyone."]},

Good for a reading group pick as there’s plenty to dissect.", "Excellent product. Thank you very much", "I am a fan of Anderson Cooper and his writing, and I have enjoyed everything else he has written. I have read many books on The Astor Family, and various members of it, and was really looking forward to this book. Maybe I just had too high expectations from Cooper's previous books.", "First I feel that Cooper is holding a personal vendetta against the Astor family. He makes it quite clear when discussing Brooke Astor's (apparent) snubbing of him when he was not with his mother at Mortimer's. As a seasoned journalist I would think Cooper wouldn't be so biased, but its all over the book. Clearly in Cooper's eyes the Vanderbilts were better than the Astors. I am sure (and I hope) that IRL Cooper doesn't still hold this apparent grudge against a family, but by reading the book you would think we were back in The Gilded Age and Anderson was not invited to Mrs. Astor's balls.", "My larger issue is that a book that for me should have been like reading my favorite type of candy this book was very dull at points. There are countless pages about things that I feel could have been explained in one or two pages (such as the massacre at the Astor House). I was shocked to find some parts of this book tedious for me to get through.", "If you don't know much about the Astor Family this does give you a full picture of the family origins and how they got where they got to, but I'd probably recommend something a little less biased.", "I am not sorry I got this book. It's a great package, and the authors are quite talented. It just wasn't what I was expecting. Still will buy future books by Cooper in the hopes they keep me as interested as his prior works.", "Very informative", "I enjoyed this book vey much. I loved reading about a lot of the history that helped make this country what it is today  and the lives of the super rich in how so many of them started out with nothing and ended up with untold riches. It may all sound grand but it's not the life I would want to live. Being super rich as so many in this book became, does not make you a happy person.", "interesting and engaging and perfect for the drive home from vacation in Acadia to home in the Berkshire Hills. We are old enough to remember when some of this story was still making news, but even that faded from consciousness without having an end. Authoritatively told by Anderson Cooper, himself an Astor.", "A very interesting book, enjoyed it!", "I thoroughly enjoyed this read. Was factual with personal experiences intertwined throughout. It provides the reader with a window to see inside one of the wealthiest times of America history and the impact on society.", "Enjoyable read but focuses on singular events/people/places so leads to patchy overall enjoyment.", "The Astor history is fascinating and an inspiring account of what early American fortunes were based on. Also how times gave changed and the opportunities of old are no longer present. But from nothing but with great vision comes wealth!!", "I haven't started to read this book yet but i read the covers and i know i well like it as i love books that are about real people and events. I have read Anderson Cooper's other books and loved them.", "I already know all about the Astors so this book held nothing new for me apart from a few quotes from valuable primary sources like Town Topics. That said however it is still an engaging, if haphazard, read.", "My greatest issue with it however is the glaring historical inaccuracies. The greatest example is that of John Jacob Astor IV, the most famous Astor of them all, the great man who lost his life on the Titanic. Due to this association, much as been written about him and his death, all which can be found through a simple glance at Encyclopaedia Titanica.  Thus I was shocked at the inaccuracies in this book regarding his final days.", "The Astors did NOT board Titanic at Southampton. They boarded in Cherbourg, France.", "But most irritating of all is the blind repetition of the ‘falling funnel’ myth that was debunked years ago.", "JOHN JACOB ASTOR IV WAS NOT KILLED BY A FALLING FUNNEL.", "There was no ‘blunt force trauma.’ His body was not crushed and sooty beyond recognition. In fact his body was almost perfectly preserved – ‘The features were unharmed, the face being only slightly discolored by water.’ (Buffalo Morning Express, 1 May 1912)", "I probably sound pedantic but I’m sorry blatant inaccuracies like this are unacceptable, especially when the subject has been written on extensively.", "(Disappointed in the front cover too. Ava Willing is not deserving of it.)", "Overall, worth a look at but know that there are far better biographies of the Astor family out there – Derek Wilson’s The Astors and John D. Gates’ The Astor Family are two that come to mind."]},

Everyone enjoys Tom Selleck's work.  From 'Magnum' to \"Blue Bloods' to 'The Sacketts' to the films he did of Louis L'Amour novels for TNT.  From LASSITER to QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER.  He's simply an entertaining actor.", "In this memoir, he tells of being raised by a loving and supporting pair of parents, whom he adores to this day.  (It's refreshing to see a celebrity, who, after they've made it, still loves and respects those raised him.)", "Selleck goes on to tell us of his basically accidental entry into show business, and how people helped him progress.  He never says, 'I did this by myself,' and credits everyone who assisted him along the way.", "He ends the book as 'Magnum' ends, so one hopes there's a second volume coming out, as Tom Selleck obviously has a great deal more to write about:  'Blue Bloods,' his work for TNT, QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER and other fine motion pictures.  Let's hope there is another volume coming out.", "Tom's style is that of a good friend who speaks from the heart. I love his expression, \"I'm a bricklayer, one brick at a time.\" That is how he built his career. He had setbacks, and his quote from the book is, \"The second kick from a mule is not educational. He knew he wanted to build his acting career and watched and learned from other successful artists.", "Tom's story is inspirational and fun to read, and his casual conversational style seems personal as if he were writing to me.", "He is a good writer, and I highly recommend his memoir. I totally agree—yes, you never know!", "It is wonderfully written, like listening to him tell his story. An insightful stroll through the life of a talented, nice man.", "A very good look at an excellent actor.  He has led a very interesting life.  It was very interesting looking behind the curtain of some of my favorite shows!", "I've always liked Tom Selleck (especially his mustache and that smile!). I've watched all the Magnum PI tv shows (loved the raised eyebrows he did in the show previews), the Blue Bloods tv show, all the western movies he's been in, the Jesse Stone made for tv movies. What an actor & that mustache! His memoir book is a very good read. He tells you about his childhood days, his acting classes as well as trying out for the tv/movie parts, his strong values in general. When you read his actual comments, I felt as though I was right there in the room with him/them. What a great man! I will definitely read this again!", "I have always liked Tom’s films and tv shows so I thought it may be interesting.  It begins with the start of his career and all along thru the years you learn of his actual personality and what he believes in. I don’t believe his career was ever easy for him but as he proceeded forward he learned the trade and changed it a little to blend with his personality to work.", "I did enjoy the book a lot.", "If you are looking for a great book to read this summer, this book is it.  Completely entertaining and inspirational.  Mind you, I am already a Tom Selleck fan, not only because I respect him as an actor, but as a person.  Having watched Magnum P. I. over and over again it was great to read about all that brought this series together, but see him be humble and gracious to all he dealt with.  Apprecitiated how he instills the benefits of having great parents and upbringing.  It plays to the person he became and is  today.  Thank you Tom for this novel.", "YOU NEVER KNOW is an apt title of this book, because you don't come out of this really knowing much about Selleck, except that he wants to be seen as a very nice guy, doesn't want to criticize anyone, and wants to keep his private life private, even in a memoir. It feels like he is playing the character \"Tom Selleck\" in the book, and not really being himself.", "Overall it's a lazily written disappointment (he must use the term \"above my paygrade\" ten times in the book) that basically ends after the final episode of MAGNUM.  He devotes a scant three or four pages to BLUE BLOODS, a show he's been doing for 13 years. Everyone is wonderful, nice and talented, even Glen A. Larson, who Selleck threw off of the MAGNUM pilot.", "It's basically a series of anecdotes about the first half of his career (primarily MAGNUM) and his romance with his wife. Not a harsh, or even remotely critical word, is said about any one he worked with or any experience that he had.", "That said, for TV buffs, he does go into a lot of production details about his busted pilots (MOST WANTED, BUNCO, GYPSY WARRIORS, BOSTON & KILBRIDE), his ROCKFORD guest shots, THE SACKETTS, MAGNUM and the movies HIGH ROAD TO CHINA, LASSITER, and THREE MEN AND A BABY.  So for that TV stuff, especially about the pilots, it was well worth the cover price for me.", "What he inexplicably doesn't talk about are all of his other movies and TV shows after MAGNUM, like IKE, MONTE WALSH, MR. BASEBALL, RUNAWAY, his failed sitcom THE CLOSER, his stint on FRIENDS, his season on LAS VEGAS, his JESSE STONE movies, producing BL STRYKER and hardly anything about BLUE BLOODS.", "It's as if he just got bored with the book and decided he was done. I can't blame him. By the end, I felt the same way.", "If you're a fan of his, Mr Selleck talks alot about how he started and how his career progressed from the 60s through the 90s. Not too much on his Blue Bloods years, nor the non-acting private facets of his life.", "He does not reveal anyone else's dark secrets either, he writes with some personal integrity and with kind words and nice stories about some amazing people from older Hollywood and his peers.", "It was an enjoyable read if you want to get to know a bit about the man and the Hollywood he experienced.", "A very refreshing book. Tom Selleck will always be Magnum to me. Even though I was too young to watch the series or remember a single episode fully, everything I have seen him in over the decades, my first thought is always it Magnum.", "If you are looking for a tell-all, name, and shame story, this is definitely not the book for you. I say this book is refreshing because it is almost universally accepted how toxic and cut throat the film industry is. Here Tom shows another perspective the camaraderie between actors coming up, the joy and excitement of creating great movies or tv series.", "These experiences might be coloured by Tom's humble personality, thinking the best of people or his mindset to always make the best of every situation he is in. This makes Tom Selleck an extremely likeable person. Yes, serendipity and luck had a hand in his success, but he is the one who \"layed the bricks,\" learned his craft, and did his best in the situations.", "Tom keeps his personal life (and army career) very close to his chest. He hardly talks about these except key milestones. He does give full credit to all the people he worked with and met over the years. One thing that made me lose a lot of respect for another actor was in their autobiography. They wrote a chapter where a veteran actor (who they name) saved their life by getting stuntman to do a stunt before them, the stuntman that dies his their place is not named. The fact that Tom did name people who took bumps for him or (indirectly) pait the ultimate price for him is a great show of humanity.", "This book spans from Tom's serendipitous start in acting to the final season of Magnum. His post work after that is done in a chapter of him looking back. This is an excellent book, of a good person, but also sees good in others, but is not afraid to stand his ground.", "Pedido rapido y correcto,todo perfecto,una pieza de coleccion para los seguidores del actor.", "Produkten kom tidigare än utlovat. Jag är mycket nöjd både med produkten och den snabba leveransen.", "Quick delivery, great price and so far a good read"]}
