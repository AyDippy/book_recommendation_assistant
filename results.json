I saw it advertised on The Today Show (me posting a review is in no way associated with The Today Show)  and she‚Äôd mentioned her quote about Job from the Bible- and I just had to give it a whirl. Well, I flew through it in two days. Her witty humor and relatable life lessons are a duplicitous way to help readers feel not alone. I‚Äôve recently lost my job, and so much of this spoke to me  (esp Job!)- I even started highlighting her quotes!  I‚Äôve been dealing with such thoughts of despair (something I normally never have) and this book had me giggling and taking notes for hard days. I just wish I could sit and have a cup of tea with Kristen to tell her how I felt like I was reading pages upon pages of my life! Well written. Bravo!", "I don't know where to start with this book. It made me laugh, had me in tears, and challenged me to think about a lot of things in a different way. Kristin is so full of love and all about grace when it comes to people and situations in her life. I loved the stories and little thoughts. The book is so beautiful! Every page is art and engages you in fun moments. I will be giving this to so many people as a gift. It's perfect for birthday, graduation, or just if someone needs a hug.", "I was disappointed as I thought it would be more of an autobiographical book. I have t finished it yet.", "Such an interesting, funny, silly memoir. An easy read filled with tongue and cheek advice, personal stories told with humility, grace and humor. Her fascinating  life story would make a wonderful Broadway show or movie and maybe someday she‚Äôll share it with the world but in the meantime pick up this glimpse of an amazing entertainer.", "Quick but fun read. I enjoyed learning more about Kristen C.", "I loved her humor and her thoughts about God. Would have enjoyed more about God and less about show biz. Her prayers were beautiful.", "This was a fun, quick read. Kristin is thoughtful, funny and no B.S.  She made me think, she made me laugh out loud, she made me a bit introspective and she validated me.  You can take what you choose to take from this book. There are  personal stories, suggestions, examples an aha moments.  Very glad I decided to get it.!", "So far I like the book. I especially like Christian Chenoweth .", "I‚Äôm still reading it so I only have a partial review."]},

Touches all the emotions, makes you smile. Reads just like your favorite album.", "I love reading because I love stories. That may seem like an obvious statement, but so many non-fiction books are recaps of isolated events or summaries of studies. I enjoy non-fiction (probably more than the average person), but my issue with memoirs is that, too often, they highlight the glamorous bits of the subject‚Äôs life, which doesn‚Äôt make for a great story.

A good bit of Dave Grohl‚Äôs music makes up the soundtrack to my life ‚Äì so naturally, I wanted to learn about his.", "Grohl takes his memoir and lays it out in five parts.

His sunny attitude radiates throughout his words, even when talking about (spoiler alert!) the death of Nirvana‚Äôs frontman, Kurt Cobain. Grohl truly tells stories. He doesn‚Äôt take you from point to point in a straight line ‚Äì he takes you on a journey through his life. He may begin a chapter about his daughter, and suddenly you‚Äôre in a French psychic‚Äôs apartment discussing other dimensions and auras.

However, Grohl tells these stories like a lucky dude who happened to be in the right place at the right time. He nerds out over his heroes just like the rest of us and continually cannot believe his fortune as he marvels at his life. That said, Grohl pulls no punches as he shares the choices he made to get to where he is: living on one dollar per day, sleeping on floors, and running down alleys from drug dealers in Europe. Despite what I consider hardships, his wisdom at a young age allowed him to see the big picture and what was possible. He didn‚Äôt need a guarantee ‚Äì he needed a chance.", "The Storyteller is a beautiful story of achieving success on your terms and because of your choices. I hope you find it as inspiring and uplifting as I did.", "He has such a great life-story and has so much to say. Always have been a fan of his- from Nirvana to Foo Fighters.

It's not just about the notes and the rhythms; it's about the soul-stirring power of music. The book captures the essence of what it means to live and breathe melodies and harmonies.", "It's become my literary comfort food ‚Äì the book I reach for in between reads, often finding myself absorbed in its pages again and again. It's one of those rare books that draws you back, time after time, with its enchanting narrative.", "Not only has it been a personal treasure, but it's also my go-to gift for friends. It's the kind of book that I'm confident will resonate with anyone who appreciates music, regardless of their preferred genres.", "If you're on the fence about picking up this book, consider this a gentle nudge.

A complete delight to read.", "Absolutely riveting, I have no idea why its taken me so long to buy this as I've been a FF fan for years.  It really is a must read for anyone who like Dave Grohl/Foo Fighters/Nirvana & rock in general.  So many great anecdotes, amazing right place right time stories.

Probably a dood time to be Noah Gittell.", "Excellent book for anyone who enjoys baseball and movies. Not only does the author express clear passion and knowledge of the subject, but his insightful storytelling through historical and cultural lenses allows readers to revel in their baseball nostalgia while challenging their perceptions and interpretations of the films. I greatly enjoyed the book and would have finished it sooner but for the interruptions catching up on baseball films!", "Well written, couldn't dispute it's accuracy, definitely covered the 80's and 90's movies (my particular love) very well.", "I love movies but haven't been a huge baseball fan, but that didn't matter - this book is at once both intellectual and entertaining - a fun and intriguing read, punctuated by incredible interviews and stories about the movies and filmmakers. I loved hearing from Richard Linklater, and the backstory on Pride of the Yankees. All stuff I'd never have looked into if I hadn't picked this up, but now will never forget. This is the perfect summer read if you want something stimulating and just really enjoyable and well written.", "I really love baseball and I love movies about it. I was really looking forward to this book and only made it about 50 pages before I gave up. The author seems to forget that movies are made to entertain at the time they are made. They are also ‚Äúof the time‚Äù of their production. So much of his writing takes the (his perceived) shortcomings of the films  to task that you want to just ask him ‚ÄúYeah, but wasn‚Äôt the movie inspiring/entertaining/ fun?‚Äù", "He also seems somewhat surprised that the movies of the 40‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs were not factual. That‚Äôs what the biz was like back then. They aren‚Äôt documentaries.", "I read the first few chapters, became really almost angry about his dissing of these and his refusal to let go his own social beliefs and see the films as of the time they were made and as commercial enterprises. I then skipped up to his take on ‚ÄúField of Dreams‚Äù(my favorite)  and ended up wondering if the author really even likes most baseball movies at all.", "If you‚Äôd like to read my copy it was donated to our local library. It‚Äôs maybe the only baseball related book I‚Äôve been unable to finish.", "Like baseball? This is for you? Like movies? This is for you? Like baseball movies? This is really for you!", "Great storytelling by the author himself, with humor and warmth. The choice of a narrator is key to a good audiobook experience. I have stopped many a listen because the voice did not fit the material. Gittell's passion for both film and baseball comes through in a natural, conversant tone, that invites the reader to accompany him on a journey of discovery -- one with fascinating details of films we know well and films we've never seen or even heard of. And it's more than that. We learn how baseball movies both reflect and impact our country, creating an unexpected synergy between Hollywood, the game itself, and American life.", "This is a fantastic book for anyone who loves films or baseball. If you happen to be a fan of both, you're in for a real treat. Noah Gittell's insightful guide made me appreciate the rich history of baseball in cinema and left me wanting even more movies about America's favorite pastime. A must-read for cinephiles and fans of the sport!", "Whether you‚Äôre a film fanatic, a baseball junkie or a social historian, you‚Äôll enjoy Noah Gittell‚Äôs ‚ÄúBaseball:The Movie‚Äù, a chronicle of cinematic hits and misses from ‚ÄúPride of the Yankees‚Äù to ‚ÄúMoneyball‚Äù. This is one of those books where you can actually feel the author‚Äôs enthusiasm for the subject matter and it is infectious.", "More than just a handy movie guide, the book is both a dissertation and a documentary about baseball movies and the American experience. The author has an engaging writing style despite tackling some serious issues here: post war angst, racism, politics, and feminism to name a few. Mr. Gittell is first a film critic, so he is has a lot to say about certain movies and their merits. I‚Äôll happily revisit ‚ÄúBingo Long‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Natural‚Äù and ‚ÄúA League of Their Own‚Äù. He also has some thoughts on actors who can actually play the game (Costner and Charlie Sheen) and some witty observations about those who can‚Äôt play or were simply miscast (Gary Cooper, Ray Liotta, Wesley Snipes, Anthony Perkins)", "The sweet spot of the book has to be Part III ‚ÄúThe Nostalgia Boom‚Äù. Not only did the 1980s produce a motherload of baseball cinema, from ‚Äú8 Men Out‚Äù to ‚ÄúBull Durham‚Äù, but also the gold standard of baseball movie stars, Kevin Costner. There‚Äôs never been another decade like it. Noah Gittell tells us why.", "Yes, it‚Äôs been years since ‚ÄúMoneyball‚Äù and as we await the next wave of baseball cinema, the author ends with interesting theories about where the genre should go next and why.", "Finally, there are some cool surprises and fun extras in this book which I won‚Äôt give away, except for one thing. The author lists his 10 Top Baseball scenes in non-baseball films. I was crushed not to see ‚ÄúThat Touch of Mink‚Äù on that list, where Doris Day sits in the 1962 Yankee dugout (yes, those Yankees), berates the ump and gets 3 very famous players thrown out of the game. Cary Grant‚Äôs comic timing then hits a home run. Oh well, I guess I‚Äôll wait for it to turn up in ‚ÄúBaseball: The Movie - The Sequel‚Äù‚Ä¶."]},

Prior to World War II, France was the center of the fashion world, but when war changed everything, the United States gradually moved from imitator to innovator, changing the industry forever.", "The book features several interesting topics including the ways fashion designs were (illegally) copied, the evolving philosophies surrounding women's wardrobes from haute couture to ready-to-wear, and the role of department stores in this transition.  The chapters about women journalists and their role in managing fashion magazines were my favorites - so fascinating.", "The author conducted extensive research for this book.  It didn't feet like an information dump, but there were so many facts, I just let them 'wash' through my mind.  At first, it felt superfluous to focus on fashion in the midst of life-and-death world war events, but I eventually dropped the guilt as I became more invested in the topic.", "Reading this via audiobook narrated by Gail Shalan was definitely the best option for me.  Thank you to Macmillan Audio for access to the audiobook.", "When Paris was taken over by the Nazis in WWII, that famous capital of high fashion began a decline that was filled by American couturiers who had previously relied on the French to lead the way in fashion, no longer only copying their styles and looking to Paris for their inspiration, Starting September 1940, American designers began to shine on their own and by 1945 American fashion began to rival that of France, and New York started to challenge Paris as the capital of high fashion", "This amazing historical novel on the growth and emergence of American fashion shows the rise of \"democratic\" principles in the fashion world - American designers began creating couture for all types of women. Sportswear, ready-to-wear clothes, and mix and match outfits became the new styles for America and signaled a new era of fashion. The first American designers of note are the \"empresses of Seventh Avenue.\"", "This book tells the story of how the Americans could move forward without Paris, for once disregarding the French Legend as the one and only source of haute couture.", "An important book for fashion lovers and for those interested in this aspect of American history, the book details the lives and stories of little remembered designers and couturiers in America who were important to American fashion.  A fascinating book that is well worth reading.", "‚ÄúConvincing American women that designs that originated in their own country were as legitimate as anything that came from Paris would require a sustained campaign.‚Äù", "From the highly polished opulence of King Louis XIV‚Äôs Versailles to the gritty streets of the New York garment district, this meticulously researched book pulls back the curtain on the American fashion industry. In this expos√©, the tenacity and creativity of a small group of women is pulled from the wings and onto the catwalk. American fashion filled the vacuum created by the Nazi invasion of France and changed the business forever. Unlike other books written about this time period, this one focuses on the war in terms of specific hurdles presented to designers and retailers and how they overcame them.", "Art, design, journalism, finance, politics and marketing all converge, producing a detailed narrative of the drama behind the relationship of Paris couture and USA ready to wear. You will recognize many names, especially some of the titans of the garment world, but here the stars are the unsung heroes; the women behind the monumental shift in the industry. I was particularly fascinated by how the marketing of women‚Äôs fashion evolved from pencil sketches to color photography and how incredibly difficult that was.", "I would categorize Ms. MacDonell‚Äôs new book as niche non fiction and those who are drawn to fashion in general and under appreciated female forces specifically, will appreciate her fine new work.", "Narrator Gail Shalan manages to dispatch the information with a calm cadence often not present in other non fiction audiobooks and I definitely enjoyed her performance."]},

At first it was just another movie to check off the list, but right from the beginning it absolutely blew me away and is now, hands-down, one of my favorite Marvel movies; a true hidden gem.", "After Simu appeared on Jeopardy! and this book was promoted in passing, I decided to buy it. I liked Simu from what I saw from him and wanted to support him, so I figured why not? However, like the Shang-Chi movie, I went in with no expectations...but I ABSOLUTELY LOVED it! I'm someone who usually jumps to the end of the chapter before reading it to see how long it is to mentally prepare myself, but I didn't do that once with this book. I didn't even think to stop. It's seldom I find a book I can't put down‚Äîso much that I can't remember the last time it's happened to me‚Äîbut this was definitely one. The stories of Simu and his parents are humbling and awe-inspiring. The book is also just full of playful humor and references that just make it a good time and makes you laugh‚Äîall while showing the struggle of trying to make it in Hollywood ‚Äî a lifestyle we all glamorize way too much‚Äîas well as the struggle that immigrants face. It makes you count your own blessings and appreciate the smaller things in life that you absolutely take for granted.", "The amount of honesty that he lays onto the page as he talks about all aspects of his life is also indescribably appreciated. I know he probably worked with a ghostwriter and editors to write this book but that aside, the words Simu puts onto the page really do seem genuine.", "I love, love, loved the book. Definitely worth the read‚Äîand a re-read at that! It's a beautiful story and just made me love Simu even more than I already did. I look forward to his next project, where I will quietly cheering at his side.", "‚ÄúIt seems like such a paradox to me that human beings are both great adapters to change and terrified by it at the same time.‚Äù", "I went in expecting a story of his journey to the Marvel Universe and I got so. Much. More. In fact, there was very little on this aspect of his life and it didn‚Äôt bother me one bit. Because the story of his upbringing and relationship with his family was so fascinating, heartbreaking, relatable and inspiring at the same time. I teared up more than once.", "At its core it‚Äôs a book of acceptance, reconciliation and forgiveness. A beautiful love letter to the family who, for better or worse, shaped him into the incredibly impressive man he is today. What I found to be most interesting is that he doesn‚Äôt just tell his own story. He took the time to interview his parents, who immigrated to Canada from China in the early 90‚Äôs, about their upbringing and told their stories to help offer an empathetic perspective into what may have caused them to have such high expectations of their son.", "I‚Äôd recommend this as a read (or listen because his voice is butter and you can hear quivers of raw emotion when he talks about his family and his dog) regardless of your interest in the MCU.", "üíö üÖ°üÖîüÖêüÖì üÖòüÖï üÖ®üÖûüÖ§ üÖìüÖòüÖñ:", "-celebrity memoirs", "-Marvel", "-inspiring coming of age stories", "-Chinese culture", "-Picture Us In The Light", "‚ö†Ô∏èüÖ£üÖ¶:", "-abuse", "-troubled family", "This book is really great, and I can't wait to start reading it a second time.

Then they gave up their good jobs and lives in Beijing to start from scratch in a foreign country under the wave of emigration in the late 80s and built a middle-class life with their hands. So far, the story is inspiring enough. However, as we know, their son became a Hollywood star, published a book to tell his family story, and became a New York Times Best Seller Author. Even a Hollywood screenwriter could not write such a dramatic life.", "Without the courageous steps of Simu's parents, this book would not exist today.", "What a magnificent life, what a touching spirit of struggle!", "Hats off to Simu's parents!", "--------------------------------", "The book is very informative. Simu tells the story of his parents' struggle from China to Canada, his own journey growing up between the two cultures and his search for his dreams. In the end, he connects all the dots and makes his dreams come true. He is very sincere and honest about his intense conflict with his parents, his anxiety, fear and even despair in the pursuit of his passion. Every first or second generation immigrant can resonate with this book. Most importantly, gain strength from the book. The road is made by people.

But also how far they‚Äôve come now.", "In parts I was smiling, laughing (out loud in public at one point, getting odd looks in the process), cringing, and crying, there were tears (hearing him talk about certain things made it so much more emotional) and just rooting for him the entire time.", "Simu has a way with words, (interviews have already shown a glimpse of this), but reading (and hearing) his own words, written by him, in his own book, just further more shows how articulate he truly is.

I found it genuinely hard to put down. Amusing, informative, compelling and - while never salacious or nasty - also honest, informative, often riveting, and (IMHO) a wholly admirable work. A writer you'll love spending time with. (As useful for fledgling directors as William Goldman's \"Adventures in the Screen Trade\" is for screenwriters.)", "I first heard about this book on a NPR Fresh Air interview and liked the idea of hearing about some famous movies from a director. After reading, it makes me want to listen to a director's commentary. I added nearly a dozen movies to my letterboxd Watchlist and it really did make me think.", "He definitely has a older white man's view on a lot of things and does come from a privileged Harvard background. But he's also worked with an amazing diverse cast of characters in front of and behind the camera and is aware of his limits as an actor and writer. And even his limits as a human being.", "I also loved how much credit he gave his wife, that was always great. And how his long friendship was clearly evident. Friendship always deserves to be celebrated.", "Yes, there are a lot of great name-drops and movie gossip.", "This is an incredible memoir of a hollywood insider. Probably the best one ever. He names names and tells tales. Finished the book in two sittings.", "When I heard about the publication of this book,, I immediately ordered it on my kindle, and I began to read it as soon as I got it.  I am so glad I read it.  If  Mr,. Zwick  had done nothing more than \"Glory.\"  I would have read the book.  This is one of my favorite films.  And there is so much more in his book.  I was fascinated by all the stories of the trials and tribulations of getting the movies done.  What is  also so good is his humanity and his deep appreciation for the work of the actors (Hitchcock famously said that actors were like cattle.\" I don't think Mr. Zwick would agree)and writers who contributed to his work.  He knows that the movies are his work, but they wouldn't be the quality work they are without all the contributions of all the others.  Thank youu for the movies, and thank you for this book.", "HAVING A RATHER SIMILAR CAREER DIRECTING, IN SOME RESPECTS, NOTHING NEW IS REALLY OFFERED HERE YIELDED MUCH NEW INFO ONLY TO REENFORCE THAT THE BUSINESS IS FILLED WITH NASTY PEOPLE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

This completely enthralling memoir gives the ordinary moviegoer a peek behind the curtain of the magic of movies. It‚Äôs funny and poignant and captivating. Highly recommend!", "How about a book from a starving artist who manages to find his way in TV and eventually movies and starts his directing career with ‚ÄúAbout Last Night‚Äù one of my favorite movies.  Swick gives the inside story of his rise, his issues, his family, but more importantly, this book is about the movie stories and his relationships with big stars.  How about directing Glory with a young Denzel Washington?  What was he like?  Could he see the talent?  Well, they worked together again so I guess that proves mutual respect.  Brad Pitt in ‚ÄúLegends of the Fall‚Äù?  Another star early in his career who is a little more difficult to manage as director/actor relationships are not perfect as all actors need different support.  Still, a successful and beautifully done movie.", "But the most impressive part of the book for me was working with Tom Cruise on ‚ÄúThe Last Samurai‚Äù.  ‚ÄúWE GET TO MAKE A MOVIE TODAY!!!!

Reading the book I realized that I have several of his movies in my DVD collection, and whenever he had something coming up I was always looking for it. Besides, he has produced also a TV show called Once and Again that I still remember how much I liked. Probably his name does not come up  among first when you think about the greatest directors but he is truly a great one, and his book is full of great stories and tidbits of wisdom for  everybody who'd think to take a camera and make his/her movie. I really, really enjoyed this book and I am now looking for rewatching his movies.", "A good read if you know this directors films", "Engaging, fun, thoughtful, well written. An expose?

The examples are shown in non-matching threads so it's clear enough to understand the instructions, but it's also inspiring to know you can make repairs that add character, not just to hide holes and prolong a garment's life. The section on dyeing is a teeny bit repetitive (but for good reason as obviously the plants and fabrics used are all different); but again it's really inspiring and I'm keen to check out charity shops for fabrics I could dye and repurpose.

Basically, we hear a lot about how Commodore Cornelius got his start, which was great, but not how he built an empire. How people make money is important. Was it hard work and smart decisions? What were those decisions? Management style? How did the transition into railroads work? Who were other important people in the businesses? Was he a straight shooter or slimy? Is there a \"great crime\" behind the great fortune? And then, we get to BIlly, his  primary heir, who in eight years *doubled* what was already the country's largest fortune, but *nothing* about how he made that happen (or whether he lucked into it). From there we hear little about the Vanderbilt involvement with the railroad, even though they seemed to be at least a little involved.", "Basically, if you're going to present the rise and fall of a dynasty, spend at least as much time talking about how it was created (the hard part) as you do about how it was dissipated.", "- The book involves a lot of time travel, with flashbacks, forward, sideways. It does this at both a chapter level and within the chapters. It was incredibly hard to follow at times, especially since I had not heard of any of these people before. This, along with sometimes not naming the people being talked about until well into a story, was completely unhelpful.

This should be mandatory reading for any woman in the film industry, any college student looking to change their major, and any women who is desperately seeking something.

This book sparkles with Seidelman‚Äôs wit and insights, her stick-to-it-ive-ness, the risks she takes, and her grit as an independent  auteur. After I finished the book, I treated myself to a Susan Seidelman film festival at home on my TV. A great book!", "I lived on the lower East side in the '60's, also West 76 th st. and across the st. from the Chelsea Hotel. Desperately Seeking Susan is one of my favorite movies.

Oh yeah, I'm 80 and my name is Susan.", "This is a rare and honest behind the scenes view about launching a career and succeeding as a filmmaker against great odds, and SUCH a fun read! Having acted in DSS, I learned much about what was going on behind the scenes from reading the delicious stories about its making. How Madonna got the part is a very cool story. Bravo, Susan!", "Lesen - lesen - lesen !", "I am still reading and I love it!"]},

I loved reading mark‚Äôs story I really hope he stays on the straight and right path for the rest of his life.", "I‚Äôm going to assume a fairly large percentage of people reading this book are fans of Lamb of God, as I am, and are therefore curious to know more about Mark, his life, and ‚Äúcool band stuff‚Äù we wouldn‚Äôt find anywhere else. Although it‚Äôs labeled ‚ÄúA Heavy Metal Memoir,‚Äù I found it to be equal parts about Mark‚Äôs life as an addict as much as a musician. Towards the end of the book, it seemed entirely about his existence as an addict and road to recovery. But I guess you can‚Äôt write about stuff you don‚Äôt remember, and Mark is honest about the fact that at the height of his addiction, he did not remember much about his time as an artist.", "From the beginning, it felt as though Mark was writing the book through the lens of a former addict trying to trace back the origin of his use and eventual dependence on alcohol, pills, and other drugs. He tells us precisely the first time he used everything and how it felt, and this theme continues throughout the book. I‚Äôm not sure if this was done consciously, as a way to help Mark remember how he used to be and keep him sober, or if a former addict in recovery can‚Äôt help but frame his life in this manner. There‚Äôs plenty of music stuff in here too, but I wish there were more. I learned a few things about Mark‚Äôs influences but can‚Äôt say I learned a lot more about the band than I already knew, except for two things: 1. Mark wrote a lot of the LOG material I love, and 2. He was high AF when he did. He is far from the only artist who produced their best material while under the influence ‚Äì Dave Mustaine wrote the best Megadeth records as an addict, and he, too, worried that he might not be as prolific if he got sober. I briefly wondered if I should be pissed that every single time I saw the band (and I saw them a lot) Mark was high and just trying to get through the show so he could score some pills and get drunk and stoned, and decided I shouldn‚Äôt. I had a good time, and hey, kudos to Mark for being able to perform fairly complex guitar riffs while being blitzed out of his mind.", "I appreciated him acknowledging his remorse for not being there, emotionally, for his friend Randy during the most difficult time of his life. As any LOG fan can testify, the ordeal surrounding Randy as he waited for his trial in the Czech Republic was trying not just for Randy and the band but for the fans and metal community at large. We all felt that, contributed money to that cause, and worried about the worst that could happen. You can‚Äôt change the past, but that regret was appropriate.", "So even though the book didn‚Äôt contain as much juicy band and metal stuff as I would have liked, I don‚Äôt regret reading it. I‚Äôm happy Mark is clean and sober, hope he stays that way, and if writing this book helped in any way, I‚Äôm very glad he did.", "I'm not normally one for memoirs from musicians as I prefer listening to their music without peeking behind the curtain. I purchased this book as I was looking for the path to recovery. The stories he told, wrapped in the stuffy blanket of addiction, blunted the severity while still making it apparent just how bad off he was. I found myself going to their albums, listening for the sloppy playing and to find the tell-tale signs of his intoxication. I also dug into some of his musical references, finding myself particularly falling in love with the live Allman Brothers album ge wrote about.", "The prologue drew me in while simultaneously horrifying me as I never realized the extent of his habits. I was also not aware of the death of his daughter Madalyn. It was all so much of a fan-based gut punch but one I needed to keep me reading.", "I am a fan of the band. I am also an alcoholic who is about to hit my first year of sobriety. This book pointed to some areas I need to work on more and refreshed my view of the music thw band puts out. It also gave me a much deeper insight into the mindset of some musicians who share their lives and music with us.", "Cool learning he was from williamsburg va. Cool to learn about lamb of god. I liked reading it. Great read.", "With any memoir, I think it's first important to establish if this is something anyone would enjoy or is it something that is primarily for fans of the author. Mark Morton's Desolation, is more of the latter. I have been a Lamb of God fan for a very long time and requested an ARC as soon as I knew it was a possibility. I enjoyed reading about Mark's history with music and stories from his life that I didn't know before. He is an incredible songwriter and hearing how some of my favorite songs of all time (Descending tops the list) came to be was such a treat. I also think there are some shining, devastating, beautiful chapters that really worked for me and would absolutely resonate with people who aren't necessarily fans of Mark/Lamb of God.", "I think where this really let me down, especially in the first two-thirds was the writing itself. The structure of each chapter starts with a song that is influential to Mark and an anecdote that explains why it's influential. These feel connected to the chapters that follow but sometimes it felt a bit redundant. A few times I thought to myself \"did I already read this?\" but it was because it was because the same story was at the beginning of the chapter. There were other repetitive sentences and themes that took me out of the book a bit.", "Overall, if you're a fan, I think you'll get something out of this but wouldn't necessarily recommend outside of the fan base.", "If you‚Äôre a Lamb of God fan, this is a must have! Mark is a great friend and I‚Äôve known him many years. His book is an amazing accomplishment of where he came from to where he is now. Get this book!", "Great book", "A great insight into one of the greatest metal bands. It's also an unblinking look at a long time addict hopefully coming to terms with himself."]},

Get it while you can", "#Reading2022 I just finished From Staircase to Stage: The Story of Raekwon and The Wu Tang Clan by Raekwon The Chef This is a MUST READ! I am a lover of memoirs and biographies they are my favorite reads. The journey to success is important for so many reasons and there is nothing like telling your own story. It is already a well known fact that Raekwon is a genius on the MIC, in the production room, in business and he‚Äôs a networking king creating opportunity for his people! I am from Newark, NJ and grew up right along all of the things written in this book. I am a year older than him! I LOVED Wu TANG CLAN day 1 - and Raekwon even before that. I am one of the few from Jersey who used to hang out in Staten Island. One of my girls had a man who lived in ParkHill projects!  (OH MY the FUN) But I digress - Raekwon not only is a lyricist but his storytelling prose in this book is so powerful and good - the pages will keep turning (or like me - those Kindle pages flash by). He is from the streets and worked his way out with a true, focused, clear and determined plan for creating joy, wealth and safety not only for his family and himself; but for his people in the streets. This story is told with honesty, humility, care and wit! Raekwon - THANK YOU for this much needed read! I can‚Äôt wait for what‚Äôs next and the next book because this man is doing it up! Sending positive vibes and love! Get this book and read it today! #Reading2022 #Book19 (I am really off this year- b/c of so many projects) #Blessed #Thankful", "I really loved this book. It has a bit of everything from true crime, spirituality, brotherhood and manhood. I think it's very inspiring for young folks who may come from similar backgrounds. Raekwon is very open in this book and doesn't sugarcoat much. He seems to be a dope person and real stand up dude which is probably why he has attracted the right people in his life at the right times.", "I recently watched the Wu Tang Saga and decided to read more into them. I almost chose another member's book but then this one popped up and I was immediately sold on it. I'm glad I chose this one to read first. I appreciate that although some relationships are no longer what they were, he gives credit to those people for the things they've done that deserve recognition.  He also reflects on and is honest about some things that he could have done differently.  I think he respectfully shares group issues which is a skill when folks have played with your money.  I respect that despite having a successful solo career Raekwon did participate in some of the group projects that he didn't necessarily believe in to help out those that may not have had as much success.", "This was definitely worth the read.  Wishing Raekwon continued success.", "After reading this book I gained insight to a person and a group to which I had legit never even heard of before. This book tells the story of Raekwon which was a member of a group called The Wu-Tang clan. Beats on his struggles growing up as a fatherless child and the overall struggles as a black child growing up in the ghettos of America. He started off as a drug dealer  but ended up turning to music as his outlet. He spoke of how the group Wu-Tang clan was formed by RZA and how the group spiraled downhill when certain members were given solo albums and other members were not. RZA had  to have all creative control over the group and really make all the decisions and it did not sit well with the group and especially raekwon who was really vocal about his concerns. Raekwon was also upset that the group would not be able to have any input as far as the beats for the songs were concerned and the overall mismanagement that was handled by the group by the founder RZA. RZA also had a brother Divine who was literally mishandling the monies of the group and that also did not sit well with them. I do not want to give this book away because it was really really good and it's really at the top of my list of autobiographies that I have read I will literally definitely recommend this book because it will expose younger readers to the sounds of original Hip Hop and also tell of all the things that were relevant then there are still relevant now. 5/5 stars a definite good book to read", "He is one of my most adored artists so I was so pleased to get this book.  It is an easy read and just a pleasure to get some insight on an performer that I love so much.  You get to see some of the man behind the art.  Love Raekwon.", "Congrats on the book! I loved it! This is the first Wu book I've purchased üôå & I haven't been disappointed! This is üî•!", "First off, I really like the Campbell tartan that Raekwon is sporting in the picture at the end. It strikes close to home, as I have Campbell roots.", "Second, I read a recent article that both Raekwon and RZA were on speaking terms again, which is good. I really possess no power to form opinions on whose ‚Äúside‚Äù I am on, but am at a point where I can take all of this in objectively. I hope to find more books on Wu members and objectively read them. I found out that GZA will be writing a book soon, so I can‚Äôt wait for that one to come out.", "I liked reading how Raekwon got his family out of the hood. It‚Äôs very admirable that he is providing for his family so that they don‚Äôt have to live the horrific life that he lived. I also read that he gives back to many communities, which is so important. I often ask myself what others are doing to make this world a better place. It seems like Raekwon is making this world a better place with his ventures and giving back.", "The Chef is known for his ability to weave intricate tales of the streets into rhymes that have forever changed the palette of Hip Hop.  With this book, he administers the same attention to detail he would with his rhymes and the result is a marvelous book.", "A very honest deep look  of  the life of my favourite member of my favourite rap group the wu tang clan alot of deep stuff about his life growing up and the inner workings of the wi tang clan a must read for any hip hop fan", "A must have for any wu-tang fan or fan of hip hop in general. This whole story is wild from start to finish, from Rae‚Äôs early life to the struggles with the Wu, Rae has been through a hell of a life.", "I feel lucky to have been around at an age & time in Hip Hop when 'Only Built for Cuban Linx' dropped to fully appreciate the power of music & what a sound/record can have on one's overall mentality, thought processes, style, persona & general creative thinking...'95 was without doubt the period where artists such as Raekwon elevated the genre to new heights & set the bench mark for artists to follow (but rarely reached).", "So this book came with much anticipation (having read Rae's fellow Wu-member U-God's book, which I found disappointing, meandering & hard to immerse myself in).", "In my opinion Rae's debut (Only Built...) & sophomore record (not officially speaking) with Ghostface Killah (Ironman) are where this book should of started & ended (like most of Rae's later albums unfortunately) as it trails off into a purely dollar chasing, bad blood boiling downward turn (grievences towards Wu management & Rza in particular weigh heavy & the working relationship/creative output of recorded material suffer as a result).", "We get a small insight into the process of making 'Only Built...but not enough to fully absorb the reader in what went into the writing process (the inclusion of lyrics/pictures etc would of been welcomed) & the talent that came through to contribute such as Nas etc (would recommend Prodigy from Mobb Deep's book as a case in point).", "Hopefully when Rae finally releases the story of 'Only Built...in celluloid form, then we will truly understand how & why this record is so important in Hip Hop's DNA. Like Biggie said 'I've got a story to tell' but unfortunately in Raekwon's case it's not as cinematic as his recorded output back in the Summer of 1995.", "Raekwon deserves all his flowers. This book really delves deep into the history of wutang and his life I couldn't put this book down. Its an emotional roller coaster leaving you rooting for the chef. Absolutely amazing book we'll written and authentic. Would recommend to any hip hop head great research material. Word is bond üíØ"]},

It is very reaffirming to read of the insecurities & constant battles even a highly successful artist faced/faces. I honestly believe the artistry comes from the intense ability to feel at extreme levels, (the good and bad). While the memoir lives up to its title, it‚Äôs not all gloom & doom. It‚Äôs a book that speaks plainly & pulls no punches, but it also lets you know that hope exists even in the most hopeless situations. A must-read.

It's nice to read another book from someone who is also a neurodivergent, and it's even nicer to see that their brain works the same way yours does. Joe does a really good job at explaining how anxiety works, and how one thought can connect to another thought, which there in turn connects to another thought that in turns makes someone more anxious. Between that and reading about that whore of a demon known as depression, there was some good things to take away from this book outside of some new music recommendations. You can tell in the writing how, through the help of therapy, he has rewired how his brain deals with depression and all those unbearable thoughts that hurt so many of us. You can see it very clearly in his writing. And to me, that was the biggest take away. Because rewiring our brain is really a hard thing to do. Rewiring those self-deprecating and harmful thoughts into something slightly more positive is hard for a lot of people.

I know I'm (always) late to the party, but I couldn't put this book down. I think that's the beauty of your/& yall's life's work: you speak to those of us who otherwise never found our voices. We could see ourselves through you. And, by talking about mental health, propelling the distigmatization movement that's happening today. I for one had quite a chaotic upbringing, and oftentimes found comfort and happiness with this band that was a constant in my life no matter what happened. It might seem silly, but it's true, it's wild to think back on how much I've grown in this time--and also realize I've been here the whole time. The shows are like coming home.

The lines of the form vibrate with life as one would find in a loose gesture drawing, the kind the studios look for in assessing the adept skills of a figure or animation artist.  This book captures the same essence of the animation with all the colors and vibrancy found in the film version.  One caveat however, is that the book version is much more saturated darker in the value key.  It seems darker and \"richer\" in the saturation of color and misses some of the softer more delicate nuances found in the animated film version.  Perhaps because of the lack of audio dialogue and actual movement, the publishers decided to go with higher contrast and stronger colors and values.  Also, many of the images are cut in half in closeups.  Perhaps a landscape style book would have worked better instead of a square version since the animation version was wide screen (1:85:1) DVD screen format.  It still reads perfectly well although there are a few spots I would have inserted some pages to make the story hitch together in continuity better.  The text is very unique in a brushpen style and the story does not narrate.  What you get is mostly the quotes in the conversation with the pictures telling the narrative.  If you see the animated film, you will make sense of the story flow in the book.", "It gets five stars for what it is.  The book is strong and nicely bound and the pages are flat with an eggshell finish to them.  The illustrations appear to be in watercolor style, perhaps a mixed media of guasch or acrylic.

Even though this book was sometimes a bit too detailed and technical for my tastes, nevertheless I learned a bit from it. Some key points:", "*These buildings were very hard to finance; the developers had to juggle many skittish lenders and almost failed.", "*They aren't unique to Manhattan; in fact, new skyscrapers are more common in Asia and the Middle East than in the West. Moreover, some high-end houses are more expensive than any condo unit; for example, one estate near Paris sold for over $300 million to Saudis.", "*Although these \"supertalls\" have a reputation for being owned by wealthy foreigners, New York has plenty of people wealthy enough to purchase even the most expensive units in these very expensive buildings. Clarke names names!", "*Some commentators have suggested that investors purchase supertalls as a way of \"laundering\" money from illicit activities. But condominiums are actually less risky in this regard than art or jewelry; an investor on the run from the FBI can easily spirit such tangible property out of the U.S., but cannot do the same with housing.", "*The law of supply and demand applies to supertalls as it applies to other housing; Clarke cites numerous examples of buyers who sold their units after a couple of years and suffered 25-30 percent losses.", "How is it possible that this masterpiece only has one review on Amazon? I have never met the author but have to say - as a former contract foreign correspondent for The New York Times - that this is one of the best, well-written business books I have ever read. Thoroughly researched, it's a real page turner. I brought the book on vacation to the Italian Alps and couldn't put it down. i live in Los Angeles and have always been fascinated by the Supertalls in New York on visits there. This is the definitive account of them. Whether you like them or hate them, every reader interested in them should pick this up. The book has many layers to it including what these buildings say about us as a society, The protagonists, i.e. the developers, are quite the characters. This book is a non-fiction Bonfire of the Vanities. Congratulations to the author for a thoroughly entertaining and informative book.", "Clarke brilliantly dismantles the complex world of real estate development, turning it into a breathtaking thriller. Her unprecedented access to the game-changing developers, architects, and investors paints an enthralling saga of ambition, desire, greed, and treachery. The stories don't just drop jaws at the glitz and glamour of the dazzling skyline, but also expose the undulating undercurrents driving such wonders.", "Any New Yorker who has ever wondered about the narratives behind these behemoths of steel and glass, will find this book irresistible. Clarke‚Äôs compelling account weaves threads of human drama, over-the-top ambitions, scandal, and the inescapable allure of wealth. Her account straddles the fabric of a gripping novel, yet every account is undeniably real.", "‚ÄòBillionaires‚Äô Row‚Äô is a keystone of investigative journalism and masterful storytelling. It provides the readers with an extraordinary journey into a realm often veiled behind the golden curtains of affluence. This book brilliantly transcends niches: whether or not you are interested in real estate or finance or are just an intrigued observer of these modern-day palaces, you'll be pulled into the narrative‚Äôs thrilling vortex.", "A highly recommended read. I hope this becomes a Netflix show!", "The book describes the real estate developers who conceived and created the five super-tall (300 meters + / 1000 feet + ) residential condominium towers in Manhattan (New York City) on 57th Street between Park Avenue and Broadway in the early 2000s. It gives the business and personal biographies of the individuals involved and also discusses the financing methods and banks and private equity companies that loaned the developers the money. There are also some interesting comments on New York City zoning regulations. I would give the book 4- or 5- Stars for all that. There is also some name-dropping of famous or at least extremely wealthy individuals who bought units within the towers. There is also quite a lot of discussion of the insane prices being charged ‚Äî and being paid ‚Äî for units in these towers and in the New York City ultra-high end tower residences in general in the 2000s. Prices typically ranged  from $3 - 4 million for a small unit to an eye-popping $240 million for a two-story penthouse. A rule of thumb was $4000 to $8000 per square foot ($43 000 to $85 000 per square meter).", "The reason I gave the book a 3-Stars rating is because there is little on the architecture and the interior layouts and decorations of the units themselves. If you are looking for photos and descriptions of what must be opulent residences, this book isn‚Äôt it. There are some general descriptions of the sales efforts, the advertising, and descriptions of the building amenities. There are also some descriptions of the architectural design features and the engineering and construction challenges in creating such incredible buildings. There are no photos of the interiors. There are also some titillating descriptions of the divorce lawsuits and financial settlements of a couple of the major developers and their wives.", "Page 337 gives an interesting statistic on the wealth of the world‚Äôs uber-rich who can afford to buy such residences: ‚ÄúAs of April 2021, ‚Ä¶ just 2750  billionaires controlled 3.5 percent of the world‚Äôs wealth‚Ä¶ ‚Äú", "Enjoyed this journalistic romp through the 2010-20s in prime New York real estate.

I honestly couldn‚Äôt put it down and looked forward to continuing it when I had to put it down. I truly enjoyed being in John‚Äôs world. The book was vivid, easy to read, light-hearted and kept me interested . It had a very positive bent. I agree with some of the commentary from other readers, such as I thought the Don Rickles chapter was unnecessary. This celebrity doesn‚Äôt interest me, but even then, John made the chapter interesting. I also agree that there are some covertly and overly comments related to possible arrogance but they are not very glaring. I got a positive feeling about John after reading his book. It is difficult to judge someone‚Äôs personality based what they wrote. He also did make some self-deprecating remarks and admitted some uncomfortable moments in his life, which gave me a more accurate picture of who he could be. In other words, I appreciated the honesty. Good work John. I‚Äôm hoping you‚Äôll write others that may delve even deeper into yourself and your work on our favorite shows like ER and Full House. Thanks.", "Just what I expected reading about John Stamos.  Had no problems getting jobs because  of his good looks. But he has insecurities like most of us. Thank you John for letting us see the real you.", "I never watched John Stamos' primary TV show \"Full House\".  Never knew he did Broadway plays.  I was intrigued by his relationship with the Beach Boys who I love.  So why read this book?  Well, he's just there.  Not super famous but definitely a good working actor with what seems like a great attitude in a major part of my life (I'm older).  Did I mention he has women fall all over him?  That's the part I'm jealous of.", "But he's a normal guy with a great, normal, upbringing that falls in to acting with a great soap opera career that starts the ball rolling and is a great part of the book.  And then The Full House with a great group of actors working in tandem which he does a great job describing.  You read many books that talks of the egos but this book focuses more on the positives of his relationships and I think that is the secret to this book and John.  He's a likeable guy who makes the best of his life.  But there is an entire other part that I wasn't aware of: a Broadway career and decently successful at it working along side James Earl Jones among others.  Another great relationship and man he respects.", "A chapter on Don Rickles?  Why not since he knew and spent time with him.  Of course, the hook will be finding Tony Danza in bed with his girlfriend.  But of more interest was his marriage/relationship with model Rebecca Romin Stamos.  Lovely woman which eventually ends in divorce and John owns up to his faults here and how he let this slip away.  (Hey John, I ran in to Rebecca and her new husband on their honeymoon trip in Riviera Maya Mexico.  They seemed very happy).  But can this honest, heartfelt guy eventually find true love?  Of course, that's where the book ends!  Read it.  it's fun.  and I didn't even mention The Beach Boys.  Lucky guy.", "I love John's transparency throughout the book. His ability to be self-deprecating and laugh at himself as he navigates his life's messiness is endearing. I thought he was a handsome man but a bit shallow before I read this. Now I know he's one of the deepest, thought- provoking, humble and grateful men I'll never know but can learn from immensely.  I'm happy he's come full-circle to become that emulation of his parents that he's always wanted to be.  The only parts I wasn't happy with were the name dropping of fellow AA (celebrity and other) members who helped him in his sobriety. As a fellow AA member myself, we don't do that without the expressed permission of those members. That's why it's called Alcoholics \"Anonymous\". Maybe he had permission from some of them but I doubt all of them. Anyhow, good read and sounds like he finally grew up. Good for him!", "I was a big fan of Full House back in the day and love reading memoirs, so of course I bought this the day it came out. I started reading the first chapter and could not get into it for some reason. Didn‚Äôt pick it back up again for almost 8 months after finishing another book and not wanting to take a break from reading and did better that time. However, I will say some of the chapters were kind of boring to me, especially about other celebrities that I had no interest in. But I get him wanting to write about people that meant something to him personally. The chapters I liked were the ones about Full House, his childhood, wives/girlfriends and his love for his parents. I‚Äôve always felt like he seemed like a humble and good person and he still seems like a pretty good guy, BUT he still came across as a little full of himself at times which for some reason, I wasn‚Äôt expecting. It took me longer to read than it should have (when I actually started reading it for real) which isn‚Äôt a good sign, but I‚Äôll say over all it was still worth the read for me. I think it really just depends what interests you share with him and how big a fan you are. If you love Disneyland, The Beach Boys and Don Rickles, this book is for you.", "I have been a fan since the original Full House was on, plus General Hospital, and ER.  He is such a genuine, warm person.  This story has lots of surprises.  This book gives you a warm feeling, he is not a Hollywood guy, very very good read.", "As a girl watching \" Full House\" growing up I always like Jesse ( John Stamos) & his bad boy ways.  He was always the character you loved to hate, but just couldn't.  Reading John Stamos's memoir & how he got into show business was enlightening; as well as; eye opening.  This year inparticular I'm starting to read more memoirs about TV personalities I liked growing up.", "It seems like John Stamos has always been around during my lifetime and looks virtually the same as he did in the 1980's.  Even though I did not watch General Hospital at the time he was on it, playing Blackie Parrish, Stamos's face was plastered on magazine covers and it would have been impossible to miss him if you were a fan of any soap opera.  Then he snagged a new sitcom as Jesse Katsopolis on Full House and almost instantly turned himself into the latest sensation on TV.  After that show ended he had a decent run on ER, playing Tony Gates.  I only saw a handful of those shows but somehow I still knew he was around and doing well in his career.  After reading his memoir, I have a better understanding why he was not just another handsome face.  He is a good actor", " in both life and on TV.  He even did Broadway a few times.  He had a close-knit family whom he loved and who adored him.  His drumming was good enough to play with the Beach Boys on many occasions.  He did charity work involving helping children that he still continues today.  And mostly he had many varied friends from his school days to the present day.  He had a lot of love in his life and eventually, he found the right partner and had a child who, I believe, will be the apple of his Dad's eye for the rest of his life.  Of course,  he fell into a few traps along the way.  Alcohol is one of them.  But his strength of character and willingness to do the work to get sober pulled him through.  He is a pretty good writer too, and the personal notes in the book from his mother were a sweet reminder of how he grew up to become the John Stamos he remains today.", "Pretty surprised to hear such sorrow for John throughout his life. Glad to see he worked through his troubles and was able to share his story.", "Such a real, honest read", "Great read!", "I grew up watching John Stamos on TV so he has 1 million fascinating stories! I want five more new books, please! üíú"]},

I will also say I have mad respect for flea and who he is as a person.

He weaves a wonderfully personal tale of vulnerability, dislocation, and manic energy as he flies through transitions and transformations from Australia to the US East Coast, to LA, and eventually out into the wide world. Despite his onstage persona and the enormity of RHCP on the music scene, Flea seems somewhere between comfortable and wickedly amused at deflating his own ego, and steers away from romanticizing his drug-fueled early days and the birth of his band. He's most beautifully serious and sincere when he talks about the people and music in his life - there's no mistaking his truest loves and where the center of his universe is. Somewhere along the line reading this book, you may realize that you're not reading some formulaic bunch of tell-all \"Rock And Roll!\" BS that may have been written by a ghostwriter. Instead, what you've got is a memoir that reads a lot like an experienced storyteller who's read the works of a lot of great authors and is reaching out, grasping for a connection to the reader through an offbeat narrative in a unique voice.

Flea is a good storyteller and a decent writer and the beginning of the book has every indication of that. I tore through the first half of the book only to discover his tiresome and obsessive preoccupation with drugs and self-aggrandizement. Throughout the book, he seems overly focused on appearing as a 'cool guy' and his constant references to some imagined affiliation to Jazz greats (Art Blakey, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie to name a few) is nothing less than annoying. Sorry, Flea, I thought you were a solid player but not in league with the Jazz masters ...", "Flea's account makes it obvious that the Bohemian lifestyle of my generation was very different from what came to be during Flea's time spent in the \"underground\".", "I think there is a trend these days of overindulgent book editors allowing so much superfluous writing to ruin what might have been a good read. I think this book could have told a more effective story with about 200 pages edited out! How many times must we read about every doobie, every shot of coke, pills and what-not smoked, popped, and shot by Flea and his friends? I kept reading in hopes of catching some of the original momentum at the beginning of the book but instead, I was disappointed by what ended up as a series of boring druggie tales. So much bravado so little time ... I recommend it to people who are interested in that period of time in Los Angeles and some of the music that evolved from there, otherwise, as they say here in old New York \"Fuhgeddaboudit!\"", "Flea was born to write.

I‚Äôve always had a deep passion for uncovering biblical truths yet I‚Äôve always been a skeptic due to so many irregularities in scripture. This book answered so many questions I‚Äôve had for over a decade and led me to a rebirth for Christ, a very strikingly similar story to that of Paul‚Äôs.

This book, her sharing her stories with the world, is a tremendous gift. This is a wonderful book for its many stories of industry, family and personalities that shaped the thoughts and actions of Cicely Tyson. Once she embraced who she was and the importance of representing to all the power, grace and dignity of her being, she was always intentional from that point on, about the roles she would accept. She was once offered the role of Christie Love, an offer she found insulting, and it was surprising to think that somehow she wouldn‚Äôt mind. For those who are old enough to remember, Get Christie Love, we can relate. And one of the great things about the book, is you will feel the same bit of odd confusion, because what had been shared about her life and career up to that point, leads you to ask, huh?", "‚ÄúABC had adapted the story for the small screen in a series to be called Get Christie Love!, featuring a Black female lead. ABC had me in mind to play Christie, Haber explained. The more I read, the lower my heart sank. He must be crazy if he thinks I‚Äôm taking part in this foolishness, I thought. Surely there had to be a mistake‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. It‚Äôs interesting that when the network heads adapted t he novel to the screen, they reimagined it with a Black woman as basically a prostitute‚Äîa narrative in line with the ma ny featured in the Blaxploitation films of that era, not to mention a reinforcement of the very stereotype I‚Äôd been attempting, with my choice of roles, to counter. That wasn‚Äôt the surprise. The real stunner was that they thought that I‚Äîon the heels of having earned every accolade imaginable for portraying the dignified Jane Pittman‚Äîwould even consider such a role. Between that and the ignorance I‚Äôd witnessed while traveling this country to address outright bigotry against Black people, no way was I about to strip down to play a hooker with a badge.‚Äù", "It‚Äôs a joyous look at a wonderful life lead with purpose and conviction, no great scandalous stories, and even the well-worn stories of abuse from Miles Davis are down played significantly. Miles‚Äô own book has a different story to tell, but Ms. Tyson states she never read the book, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt need to read a book to know what was true. I lived it. And no written account could fully capture what I know happened between the two of us.‚Äù", "Simply, just an all-around great read and her ‚Äúwriting collaborator‚Äù Michelle Burford is undoubtedly responsible for the literary flourishes that makes this book sing and soar and Tyson is effusive in her acknowledgment of the talent and ‚Äúthe poetry of the pen‚Äù that brings this work to the epitome of excellence.", "Enjoyed reading Cicely Tyson's book. Her history and life story are truly inspiring regardless of your race. Since reading, I have have been watching her famous films which I hadn't seen before. She's a great actress. She chose only films that portrayed the dignity of Black people.  The book is interlaced with Black history. She's a great lady whose family came from Nevis, a Caribbean Island. Lived to 98.

These 101 pages capture what life is like in 2019; at least in most western countries with people of a certain age range.

The only part that was a little boring was towards the first half of the book when he went through the history of reality TV going way way back, and I got a little bored. But honestly that was the only part I found boring! I just thought it was so interesting and I wish I had more books to read like this. Usually when I read stuff in this genre it‚Äôs written by a celebrity who has a ghost writer and it‚Äôs honestly just never very good.

To my pleasant surprise, this is much deeper and more comprehensive. Brian clearly is a fan, which makes this book special in that it celebrates the franchise, yet at the same time, provides a very detailed, well researched, look at this global phenomena. As a lifelong student of pop culture (BA/MA in Media Studies), I am both impressed and jealous of his accomplishment.  His analysis in latter chapters is on par with academic journals. My favorite chapters involve BravoCon and his Vacation with Vicki as they provide real insight into the personalities of fans as well as the Bravo machine.

It's too bad, because Moylan is a clever and engaging writer, and how the Housewives sausage gets made must be a fascinating story.

This is a sort of chaotic autobiography, with Bronson taking the reader on a journey from his early days in Queens all the way up to current pandemic times.  His blunt style of storytelling, brutal honestly, and somewhat carefree sense of humor are all on full display; and fans of his music or his TV shows will be able to picture him telling these vivid stories.", "Bronson starts by describing his upbringing in Electchester, a neighborhood in Queens.  Bronson writes about what is was like for him growing up; the people in his neighborhood, and the social environment of being a kid in Queens in the 80's and 90s.  He attributes much of his confidence and thick skin to the environment he grew up in, as he always had to be able to defend himself verbally and learn to be quick with a joke.", "Bronson then goes on to describe various memories and important events in his life.  Bus rides, camps for overweight kids, his crazy teenage years; all played a part in molding his personality.  His chapter about ‚ÄúThe Steroid Years‚Äù was a little surprising, as he describes the phase of his life where powerlifting was his main focus.  At one point he was leg pressing 1500 pounds, which is pretty impressive, and I never would've guessed he was that strong.  Bronson admits that he trained so hard to lift heavy because it gave him confidence and made him feel like he could be intimidating; until he suffered from a hernia that made him have to change his habits.", "The Chapter titled ‚ÄúF it I'll Start Tomorrow‚Äù is mostly about Bronson's battle with his love of food and thinking about dieting or eating more healthy.  This chapter might really resonate for many people, as in the modern Western world many of us have had these same battles with weight loss.  Bronson discusses his ice cream addiction, and his internal mental battles that have plagued him throughout his life.", "There is a chapter about how Bronson's life changed after he broke his leg and had a long period of self-reflection.  He became more focused on his music and making a life for himself, and has been trying to work toward getting things done ever since.  This section of the book in particular does have some inspirational messages, as he advises everyone to find a way to personalize their own  lives, instead of settling for what is presented to you.", "The last chapter of the book was written during pandemic times, and discusses how life has been different for Bronson while living his new quarantine lifestyle.  This book documents an interesting evolution, as in the last chapter of the book Bronson mentions some of the different ways that he has changed since writing the first few chapters of the book.", "All in all I really enjoyed this book.  I think fans of Bronson will not be disappointed at all, but people that are unfamiliar with him should know in advance that it is mostly a messy autobiography of his life; especially his early years, and isn't really intended to be deeply meaningful or convincing.  He is just a man that struggles with the same things that many of us do, but approaches life with a pretty good sense of humor about it all.", "If you're a fan or appreciate Action for who he is you'll like this book. He's inspired me with my love for music, food, travel, and enjoyment of life. I'm really happy to have read this and gotten some more details about his personal life.", "excellently, written, and very captivating", "Haven‚Äôt read it yet but great price", "another gentle side to Action.

What are you doing?", "AB is a local hero to me and this book really motivated me to make a difference with my lifestyle.", "I've loved Action Bronson's music and tv shows for years now and immediately picked this book up on drop day. Such an insightful look into this man's life, outlook and power to change.

The book is captivating.  Its a tale of two intelligent, competitive men in a complicated relationship.  Book is also funny, enlightening, and thought provoking.  So much more than I envisioned. One of my best reads in several years.", "For a generation of young movie fans in the 80s, Siskel & Ebert (Ebert & Siskel) were perhaps the most trusted adults in our lives. I watched \"At the Movies\" and later, \"Siskel & Ebert\", more religously than perhaps any other show since being weaned off \"The Electric Company\". So deeply etched into my mind are these two that while reading \"Opposable Thumbs\" I could actually hear their voices in my head. Singer's book not only provided a rich history of how the show came to be and how these two became some of the biggest celebrities in film, but reminded me of some of the most instructive and entertaining television I've ever watched. I suspect like many other readers, I spent a lot of time looking up referenced clips of their show and appearances on Letterman and Carson and feeling as drawn to these two men as we were when we were younger. While we see this kind of crosstalk everywhere these days what the modern version lacks‚Äîthat Singer's book so completely cements‚Äîis that Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert were not characters playing it up for the camera, the camera captured who they were and beamed it to all of us.", "I didn‚Äôt always agree with Siskel and Ebert. They got things wrong on occasion but they sure were fun to watch and listen to. I do have an issue with the subtitle of the book though. They didn‚Äôt change the movies-they changed the way people TALKED about the movies. They changed how we engaged each other about the films we love and hate. Their influence still stands in print and on TV.", "Both men were intelligent, acerbic and traded barbed quips about films so well that one might jot realize that they couldn‚Äôt stand each other in the very beginning. Heck, they disliked each other when the first met. It was the competition that did it. Ebert saw Siskel as the rival newspaper‚Äôs answer to him and Siskel saw Ebert as a competitor to take down.", "That did change with time. At first, they were a pair of prima donnas; when Roger got a cushion so that he was at the same height as Siskel on screen (it makes it easier to frame the shot), Siskel had to have one, too. The secret weapon behind-the-scenes was Thea Flaum. The co-producer of the show groomed the pair so that their reviews and quips on screen would flow giving them tips,to make their written reviews translate to the screen. She taught them television even goi g so far as to tell them to get a new wardrobe because, as she noted, the way they dressed on screen looked awful. Without Htea, there would be no Siskel & Ebert. The pilot was a disaster but she knew there was something there and helped them hone their television craft.

It concludes with Roger Elbert‚Äôs illness, the show carrying on without him while he recovered and his eventual death.", "There‚Äôs a nice appendix of overlooked films that each man championed over the years.", "Siskel & Ebert changed the way that we, as audience members, saw the movies. They were a unique pair, brilliant and challenged each other every step of the way. I don‚Äôt believe either man would have it any other way.", "This book did so much for my better understanding of and appreciation for these two brilliant icons. I am not prone to go to movies but I often would only go to see movies that had come under the scrutiny of Roger and Gene. I was in graduate school in NYC 1980-83. With my limited funds I often found myself on the subway seeking out a theater somewhere in the boroughs to see the movies that they had discussed/debated that even in their disagreement would pique my interest so that I had to go see for myself and decide with whom I agreed.  As Singer points out Gene and Roger both loved movies and loved discussing them and were committed to fostering people not only seeing but talking about movies. And no one before or since has done it better.", "Singer also filled out the back stories of the men, the people with whom they worked, the various permutations of \"the program\" and of their personal relationship. I  laughed, cried and \"a-ha'd\" myself giddily through this quick paced and superbly written book - of which the two marvelous writers themselves would assuredly given 2 thumbs up!", "Final thought.

What I did not expect was how enjoyable it would be to read. Somehow the author manages to provide a fresh, non-judgmental take on modern royal history. Instead of dwelling on low-hanging, scandalous fruit, the book really pulls the common threads from the work of four different royal women to reveal how each uses sartorial skills in her own way. I have been reading royal books all year, and there were even a few tidbits I didn't know (like how William's red uniform was chosen for his 2011 wedding). I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the fashion of royal ladies, and anyone looking to for a new perspective on the soft power wielded by Britain's #1 cultural export.", "I'd never followed royal fashion all that closely before.

I am now a massive fan of Elizabeth Holmes and SMT!  In this book, Holmes chronicles, the evolution of the styles of Queen Elizabeth II, Diana, Princess of Wales, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.  I especially love how she chronicled the modernization of Her Majesty's style at the turn of the century, how fashion helped Diana grow from shy teenager to confident young woman, Kate making bolder fashion choices in recent years, and Meghan wearing brands that promote causes and issues she supports.", "I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about royal fashion.", "I'm finding this read incredibly enjoyable! Packed with photos and all of the insightful and interesting observations, much in the same style as Elizabeth Holmes' Instagram SMT breakdowns are, but she absolutely does have so many thoughts bc she easily filled the pages with new fascinating content!

Each of the sections are great and there is something fun and interesting for all fans of the royals! Even if you‚Äôre just a casual fan it‚Äôs impossible not to get excited catching glimpses and stories behind some of their biggest fashion moments. Five stars!!! Gorgeous photos and thoughtful commentaries!!!", "This book would have been perfect with the 3 true royals but adding the fake one detracted from the book. She also definitely has no style even close to the 3 original and legendary British women.", "Not surprisingly, this is undoubtedly the most gorgeous ‚Äî and the most thoughtful ‚Äî book I‚Äôve ever owned. And while I knew the photos would be gorgeous and meticulously selected from following the author‚Äôs entirely addictive Instagram account {@eholmes} before the book was even announced, I was stunned at the level of detail, the artful storytelling, the depth of insights... I absolutely devoured HRH. And I‚Äôm reading it again, now, as a companion piece to a full rewatch of The Crown. I hope this is only Holmes‚Äô first book ‚Äî it is art and it is amazing.

I grew up with photos and stories of many of the people who populate this book, and I couldn't escape the legacy of Country Western Music even if I wanted to (I don't).  The well researched and deep understanding of his material that the writer brings to this work makes it a delight to anyone with even a passing interest in the oversize egos and wild lives that have characterized this genre of music.  The author takes as his starting point, what has been described by one American singer Songwriter as \"The Day the Music Died,\" the plane crash that took the life of Buddy Holly at the height of his powers, and then focuses principally on the careers of Waylon Jennings (who was supposed to be on that plane), Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson from the 1950's into the 21st century.  Along the way he focuses on the oft examined \"Outlaw\" movement and what it meant to the studios in Nashville and the artists they tried to manage and manipulate.  Of course, the author is familiar with many of the other luminaries in this and other genres of music who also played a role in events from Bob Dylan to a variety of rockers and gospel singers.  It is a surprisingly textured and nuanced look at things although I find the later chapters, with their increased emphasis on deeply controversial features of our modern culture, far less interesting, primarily because of the ideological stance of the author, but this in no way negates his accomplishment in examining in depth an important feature of our modern culture much of which is seldom explored in a more than superficial manner.  This book is well worth the read for anyone who ever wondered about what goes on behind the curtains of the music industry.  I have no hesitation in endorsing it; it belongs in every library and on the shelves of many fans who have often wondered about the lives of the men and women who dominate the Country Western genre.", "Reading \"Willie, Waylon and the Boys\" was so much fun.  I read a bit, then I listened a bit to the songs and albums mentioned.  It was a very satisfying and thought provoking way for a music geek like me to spend hot summer days.  It tells the stories of the challenges, successes and setbacks faced by Willie, Waylon, Johnny and Kris as they tried to make it in Nashville Music City. The stories of how the songs and recordings came to be were especially interesting.  I learned a lot and feel more oriented in the context.  And, it was full of ripping good tales.  5 stars!", "The author jumps around and the book never finds a theme. You could probably learn more reading a few Wikipedia articles.", "A very good and fun history of Willie, Waylon and the boys.  Well worth the time.", "I‚Äôm not one to write book reviews, but this book so frustrated me, I felt I had no other choice. If you must read this book, please check it out from your local library and save yourself $25. I was drawn to this book because I wanted to read about Willie, Waylon and the ‚Äúoutlaw movement‚Äù and what I got was a confusing mess. This book felt clunky, and was at times confusing and did not flow well. The book seemed to suffer from scope creep, where the Author decided to add as much content as he could, information that wasn‚Äôt really what the book was about.", "His recounting of historical events sounds like he read a few articles and then inserted them into the manuscript. I‚Äôm used to reading historical works, and this doesn‚Äôt compare to other historical biographies I‚Äôve previously encountered. There were multiple sentences I had to read several times to understand what the author‚Äôs intent was. There were times he bounced from one name to another, and I couldn‚Äôt tell whom he was writing about.", "I‚Äôm also confused by the inclusion of the later chapters about Alt Country or the Highwomen. This is where I felt the editing let the author down. The title suggests you‚Äôre going to get an in-depth look at the outlaw movement from its heyday and instead you get out of left field mentions and random footnotes and a whole section on Jason Isbell and Sturgill Simpson!", "Maybe my expectations were too high, but this was a disappointing effort. Though I‚Äôm not familiar with other titles on these artists, I‚Äôd bet there are better books out there already covering this subject matter.", "This book is in my wheelhouse.", "I grew up listening to Outlaw Country with my grandparents and getting this inside look at its inception and legacy really hit me with all the feels.", "Brian Fairbanks takes the reader back to before outlaw country was a thing--- to see the motivations and moments that led Waylon, Willie and the boys to take that leap into creating their own brand of content.  From making what could be inside baseball moments with recording studios and producers entertaining to showing us the depths that addiction drove these men to at points in their journey-- the reader gets the full gamut of the ups and downs of changing the music scene.", "I loved getting a closer feel of Waylon and Willie and Kris and Johnny. The anecdotes helped give humanity to the larger than life Highwaymen I grew up listening to on the radio.", "I also really enjoyed the final few chapters. Fairbanks explores their legacy in ways that I hadn't thought about and it helped the book come full circle."]},

So much fascinating behind the scenes peeks and answers to things I've always wondered about. Film is the ultimate collaborative art form. With so many people involved, it's a wonder anything ever gets made at all. Especially the over the top blockbusters that wowed a global generation. While younger readers will likely enjoy this, they won't actually remember when these movies hit the multiplex. But for those of us who lived it, this is an insightful glimpse into how those seminal pictures got made, when and why, and the cultural and historical circumstances that in hindsight make them all the more poignant.  Arnold playing Hamlet? Absurd, right? In Last Action Hero, when he says one of the most iconic lines in history, To be or not to be? Not to be., it seems a mere action genre puff of a cigar to be met with an eye roll. But when you understand the context and that this is Arnold speaking about a generational shift, the ending of an era of movies that made us, one whose ilk we'll likely never see again, this cheesed*** line suddenly becomes heartbreaking in its prescience. Nick de Semlyen illustrates this beautifully,  crafting a book I couldn't put down and lost a lot of sleep while enjoying fully. He's created a textbook for the Action Film genre, one every bit as fascinating as the epics it explores. I didn't want it to end.", "Not deep but an entertaining read that carries you along, telling the behind the scenes stories of the action heroes of the 80s. Popcorn nonfiction, but exactly as advertised. If you want a light read and like the stars, you will enjoy.", "This book was a nice trip down memory lane, and contained a lot of information that was new to me. The inclusion of Chuck Norris and Jackie Chan (whom I practically worshipped as a teen in the 90s), and Dolph Lundgren especially, felt a little forced or like an afterthought, but for me the book was a real page turner, and I was bummed when I reached the end. 4.5 stars and very much recommended.", "I usually read a little heavier stuff but these movies were the mainstay of my teenage years.  All kinds of anecdotes, behind-the-scenes insights, and stories behind the stories.  Well written and fun to read.  Lost sleep because I didn't want to put it down!", "The first two-thirds of \"The Last Action Heroes\" is fantastic, recounting great stories of Stallone, Schwarzenegger and company as hungry up-and-comers in the action world, with many great anecdotes that focus on Steven Seagal's monstrous ego, however the author, Nick De Semlyen, seems to run out of steam towards the last third of the book and was clearly trying to just get it finished.  The last third, which covers the mid-to-late 90s and recounts the downfall of the muscle-bound action movie stars (Van Damme did a lot of coke) is written with less quotes, feels rushed, and leaves out a lot of historical moments: There is no mention of Schwarzenegger's heart surgery or his appearance as Mr. Freeze in \"Batman and Robin\", both of which were huge turning points in his career which he never recovered from.  De Semlyen doesn't mention the rooftop horse stunt that almost killed Schwarzenegger on the True Lies set, which Schwarzenegger detailed in his own autobiography \"Total Recall\".  Also, when it comes to Jackie Chan, there is no mention of Rush Hour 2, which holds the record for largest domestic box-office opening weekend for any of the action stars covered in this book, which is a major milestone that should have been a significant moment in the telling of Chan's story.  It also would have gone a long way to wrapping up the story in a more satisfying way if De Semlyen obtained fresh quotes from the hunks reflecting on their end of days.", "Also, the Epilogue is plagued with questionable conclusions when it comes to our new era of \"inclusive\" action heroes as replacements for the beefcakes of the 80s and 90s.  De Semlyen mentions Simu Liu, Jason Momoa and Chadwick Boseman as proof that mainstream action has become richer and more diverse, however, in these cases it's the 'franchise' and 'character' that's the star, not the actors themselves.  Kids on the playground will always pretend to be Schwarzenegger, but no kid knows Simi Liu, they know \"Shang Chi\".  It's almost inconceivable that De Semlyen doesn't mention this phenomenon on the caped and masked stars of today versus the Stallone-era heroes: Captain America and Thor can open movies to a large box office, but Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth can not.  Also De Semlyen mentions the movie title \"The Woman King\" as an example of putting new kinds of heroes on the screen, however the author cleverly sidesteps the fact that \"The Woman King\" was not successful, ending its global theatrical run breaking-even financially.  De Semlyen really wanted to make a last-second point about inclusivity, but bringing it up for 1 page in the epilogue without quotes or statistics doesn't make the point he thinks he's trying to make.", "Overall, if you grew up watching Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis and Van Damme on constant repeat like I did then this is definitely a good read, even if the book ends on a whimper instead of a bang.", "This was a fun book and a trip down memory lane.  Didn't want to put this book down or for it to end.  Laughing out loud numerous times.  Recommend this for anyone who grew up in the 80s and 90s who remembers seeing these larger than life action hero on screen.  Some great behind the scenes facts.  Thoroughly researched.

I wish I could afford to actually see them in the wild, but for now Nat Geo and books like this fill the void. The book gives a quick blurb about the animal's size, habitat, diet, and population status and has a great feel and vintage look to it. The only complaint I have (reason for 4 stars) is that a proceed of the purchase does not go to help protect these beautiful animals.

Not just because I love the show so, so much, but because I get Jenna and Angela's friendship. My best friend came from our years of being active duty Air Force. It's a bond most people just cannot understand. When I listen to Jenna and Angela talk about their friendship, about the ups and downs, about how they can gab for hours, about the intense desire to be together again after The Office ended, I get it. I really, really get it. I cried when they talked about Jenna breaking her back in New York and Angela taking care of her, because when I was pregnant with my fourth child, I started bleeding and was put on bedrest WHILE MY HUSBAND WAS IN ANOTHER STATE. My best friend moved into my house with her 2 year old and took care of my 3 kids, her daughter, and me. She scolded me if I lifted a finger. She did everything. She was amazing in a time when I had no family around and no other options available to me, and SHE suggested.

She now lives in Florida, I live in Ohio, and we do our best to get together several times a year. We always go to her house for spring break. She always comes here for New Year's Eve (because my birthday is January 3rd). We do a family vacation together as often as we can - with all 7 kids (I have four, she has three). From meeting in Hawaii to meeting in Gatlinburg for Thanksgiving to Disney World and even taking all those crazy kids sailing in the Virgin Islands. Our daughters, who I say have known one another since before they were born because she and I were pregnant at the same time (me with my third, her with her first) are now also best friends and our kids call each other cousins. Our husbands put up with us, but thankfully, like each other as well. More importantly, they understand what this relationship means to us.", "While our families getting together is very important to everyone, we try to do one girls' trip every year because we don't see each other as often as we would like. She's gone with me to book conventions (I'm an introverted author who stresses about marketing herself and she's super out-going, so it helps a lot!), we've traveled back to Charleston, SC where we met (and we got matching tattoos together), we've gone to the Dominican Republic, we've gone to New York and saw three plays in three nights, and we have so many more trips planned. Those weekends are always a tangle of talking, drinking, laughing, and memories, and I savor them.", "Anyway, I say all of this to point out that this book is aptly named.

He was and is a unique talent, whose memoir is as unique and fascinating as the man himself.", "From a traditional Jewish family of modest means in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, Harvey becomes one of the greatest theatrical writers of the day. His parade of hit shows is like a history of gay theatre from the 1970s until this day. TORCH SONG TRILOGY was an utterly ground-breaking endeavor, an epic three-part play about a gay man coming to terms with his life - his search for love, the challenges of keeping love, his demand for respect from his harshly judgmental but oddly loving Jewish mother. This in the 1970s, when such boldly, outspokenly gay heroes were in scarce supply.", "Like any great storyteller, Harvey (everyone calls him Harvey) elides over the sustained trauma. He talks candidly about his battle with alcoholism, but his recovery - poof! (OK, that's a gag.) He *does* seem to recover within a few pages, with little of the drawn-out torture of most alcoholics. He and the famously combative Arthur Laurents have their disagreements, but Harvey seems to cave to the imperious director's demands with no repercussions. And LA CAGE AUX FOLLES is a huge hit, which makes him even more famous and delightfully rich.", "But the backstage peek at the great parade of shows and talent, from Jerry Herman to Stephen Sondheim (who said no to collaborating) to the great director-choreographer Jerry Mitch to Cyndi Lauper, is delicious. Harvey knows everyone - and I mean everyone - in the theatre. He does film and television, but his heart belongs on stage, playing characters larger than life, from Arnold Beckoff in TORCH SONG to Tevye in FIDDLER ON THE ROOF to the unforgettable Edna Turnblad in HAIRSPRAY. The voice, the timing, the drollery - there is no one as funny and bawdy and endearing as Harvey.", "Ditto this enchanting history of his collaborators, his lovers, his co-stars, the backstage people who make everything happen.", "For anyone who loves theatre, this is a Must Read. If you don't love theatre, do I even know you?", "This book is mostly about theatre and a lot about Broadway as told by the diva who lived it. I'm familiar with Harvey since I saw Tidy Endings on HBO in the 80s and of course all of us gay actors in little theatre dreamed of doing Torch Song back when it was edgy and dangerous.", "Harvey is wonderfully chatty, entertaining, and honest. Who knew his circles were so expansive? He name drops not like someone out to impress, but like someone who considered nearly everyone a friend. His stories are told casually as anecdotes and I catch myself pausing to reflect, \"Wait. This person is a megawatt talent, a Broadway icon, a legend. How are they so very real?\"", "And so very wise. Harvey shares quotable observations about life generously because he's done the work, paid the piper, and loves like a bubbe.", "I really enjoyed reading this book.  I knew little of Harvey's work beyond Torch Song Trilogy and Mrs. Doubtfire, but I've always liked him so I bought the book.  I'm glad I did.  This was an interesting read and his sense of humor is great throughout the book.  Boy, did I ever learn a lot about him!  I had no idea just how involved he was behind the scenes with various well-known productions, and all the famous people with whom he has worked.  Who knew!  I would definitely recommend it.", "Fierstein writes with such a captivating pizzazz that you feel his experience.", "I already recommended it to my book club and look forward to discussing it with my friends.", "100% recommended", "Even if I've seen so much of Harvey's work over the years, I was ultimately fairly clueless as to just how much he'd actually done. A very interesting look into  a true insider's POV to the theatre, film and television worlds. Clearly, he's a tremendous juggler with all the balls he can manage to keep in the air. Definitely want to now do a deep dive into what to can to view and/or revisit his roles and writing.", "I've loved Harvey for a very long time.  This was such an amazing and intimate look into his story, full of so many moments and stories and emotional upheavals!! I loved every word.  I'm so glad I read it, and recommend it to everyone with even a vague interest in theater.  Absolutely brilliant.", "It has a few good laughs and gossipy tidbits, but it doesn‚Äôt really add up to anything. Fierstein doesn‚Äôt seem to have any particular purpose in writing the book. It seems pretty slapdash, like what you‚Äôre looking at is the first draft. Strange, since his scripts always have a solid overarching driver. Could have used a stronger editorial hand, and the bad grammar! (Really, Harvey? You and the good folks at Alfred Knopf don‚Äôt know the difference between ‚Äúme‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äù?!) If you follow theater, you‚Äôve already heard most of these stories. Unless you find it discounted or something, not recommended.", "Everything I thought he might be, he is, and more.  The flow of work through his life and things coming full circle.  Brilliant.", "Il libro √® bello, ma era rilegato grossolanamente, con i fogli non tagliati correttamente", "I love this book. I haven't gotten through all of the book yet but it is a great, interesting read. The book quality though is kind of odd. The pages are either not bound correctly or the didn't trim the sides as it isn't even on the sides", "‚ÄúScathingly brilliant,‚Äù to quote Hayley Mills in The Trouble with Angels. ‚ÄúAmusing and diverting,‚Äù to paraphrase Joanna Lumley in Cold Comfort Farm. ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death!‚Äù to channel Rosalind Russell as Auntie Mame.", "Perhaps I‚Äôm focusing rather too much on divas, but Mr Fierstein‚Äôs fabulous memoir rather lends itself to such thoughts. After crafting so many wonderful stories that have entertained (and educated) us over the years, he is, at last, telling his own story, and an absolutely amazing story it is.", "What an amazing writer and talented beyond a definite read"]},

Eyal introduces the concept of \"traction\" ‚Äî deliberate actions that draw us closer to our life goals ‚Äî as the antidote to mindless scrolling and the endless ping of notifications. His advice ranges from the practical (send fewer emails to receive fewer) to the philosophical, urging a reevaluation of how we interact with technology so that it serves us, not the other way around. The book's strength lies in its mix of actionable strategies and thought-provoking insights, making it a beacon for anyone seeking to navigate today's digital landscape with intention.", "However, Eyal doesn't shy away from the challenges that come with adopting a more focused lifestyle.

Indistractable is about building habits to build a more mindful life. I think both of these books are of massive benefit to those both those who work in technology and those that use technology. It's important to understand how companies build products while it is also important to understand yourself and how you react to certain triggers.", "One final thing I would like to point out is Nir's attention to detail.

From the exhilarating highs of stadium tours to the introspective moments of creative solitude, Lee navigates his musical odyssey with unwavering passion and dedication.", "What truly sets \"My Effin' Life\" apart is Lee's ability to intertwine the story of Rush's rise to stardom with his personal reflections, creating a harmonious blend that resonates with readers. His anecdotes and insights not only celebrate the music but also delve into the challenges and triumphs of a life dedicated to artistic expression.", "Lee's storytelling prowess shines as he delves into the intricacies of his musical genius, offering behind-the-scenes glimpses into the creation of iconic albums and the evolution of his craft. His passion for music reverberates through the pages, captivating readers and offering a profound appreciation for the artistry behind the melodies.", "Moreover, \"My Effin' Life\" is not solely about fame and music; it's a heartfelt exploration of Lee's growth as an individual. His reflections on life lessons, personal struggles, and moments of self-discovery add depth and authenticity to the narrative, making it a relatable and inspiring read for fans and newcomers alike.", "The book's candid nature, coupled with Lee's engaging prose, creates an immersive experience that transports readers through decades of musical history. Whether you're a die-hard Rush aficionado or simply someone intrigued by the life of a music icon, \"My Effin' Life\" is a captivating journey that leaves a lasting impression.", "In essence, Geddy Lee's autobiography is a compelling testament to the power of music, resilience, and the indelible mark of a true artist. \"My Effin' Life\" stands as a must-read memoir that resonates long after the final page.", "While ‚Äúthoughtful and complex but utterly approachable‚Äù can be used to describe Geddy Lee‚Äôs imaginative, durable and widely under appreciated band, it also aptly describes his autobiography.", "I do not generally read autobiographies.  They‚Äôre a tough medium to love, as they often feel hard to start, self indulgent or self pitying or so deep in the weeds as to lose the reader.", "Not this one. My Effen Life is at times funny and sad, but always interesting and never off key (very on-brand for Geddy Lee). It is a tale extremely well told. The author manages to weave together stories of his lonely and marginalized childhood in an ethnic Jewish enclave on the fringes of the city, son of Holocaust survivors with a raucous rise to fame in rock and roll‚Äôs mad early heyday, with the challenges of stardom and persistence. Into this narrative he tells the harrowing story of his families long and painful ordeals during the European genocide, which shaped his parents‚Äô worldview, and ultimately his own.", "There is much for a Rush fan to love in this book. It goes into great detail on the construction of their music, the motivations, drivers and musical tensions involved in every evolution of their music. It delves into technical details about their instruments, studios, stage kit, and light show. In an engaging way, Lee shares the intimate bond between himself, Lifeson and Peart‚Äîin the studio, on stage,and on the road, through their many ups and downs. He also introduces you to crew members, friends and family‚Äîhighlighting their important to the band‚Äôs success. It tells a story of a talented, hard working if a bit nerdy and ethereal band who believed in themselves and believed in their fans, which explains the huge almost ‚Äúunderground‚Äù fan base that still persists.", "It‚Äôs a story of a life still in progress, punctuated by incredible triumphs and unimaginable losses. It is an easy book to read not just because it‚Äôs interesting but also because it‚Äôs well crafted.  There is much for a non-Rush fan to love in this book, too.", "Though Rush is no more, I suspect most readers will come away expecting more  to come‚Ä¶someday ‚Ä¶from its bassist/singer/resident bossypants.", "BTW, read the footnotes. Lee shares awesome nuggets in these stage asides", "When I was 16 years old, a very long time ago, I was invited to go to a concert of a band by which I had only heard one song. I was so happy to have been invited that I went. That band was Rush, and I have been a fan for 44 years. When I saw that Geddy Lee had written this memoir/autobiography I knew I had to pick it up, and I am glad I did. Lee's parents met as teens in a Nazi concentration camp, survived to marry come to Canada and give birth to three children, the oldest of whom was named Gerschon, which was Angelica sized to Gary, which his mother with her accent pronounced Geddy. Chapter three of the book tells the tale of his parents lives and it, alone is worth the price of the book. From there the story of the rise of Rush is told with extreme transparency and honesty as well as humor. This was a band that genuinely loved each other throughout their career. Lee's account of the events surrounding the death of drummer Neil Peart from brain cancer is touching and poignant.", "My Effin' Life is one of the most fascinating books of this type that I've read. It provided me with a lot of insights and more than a few surprises. One of the things I always loved about this band was in a world where so many bands were singing about sex, drugs and rock and roll, these guys were recording songs that were genuinely thought provoking.", "I will admit, I was a little taken aback (maybe surprised is a better word) by all the references to drug use by the members of the band. I know that may sound incredibly naive on my part, but I had always kind of assumed that playing the kind of extremely complex arrangements they created would have required a high degree of sobriety to pul off live. That not withstanding, I consider Rush to among the greatest bands of all time, and this book is a must read for any fan.", "As I was never a huge Rush fan, I did enjoy some of their output. I was more interested in finding out about why this band was held in such high regard...now I know. 3 super talented musicians and the story behind their success all told by Geddy Lee. My Effin' Life is worth a read for anyone even remotely interested in the group's history or music. Well written account of Geddy's life as well as his family's ordeal in the war years which reflects on who Geddy came to be as a person and talented musician. I have read countless Rock bios over the years and this one certainly stands out! Highly recommended!!!", "A perfect book for those looking for a deeper connection with Rush's and Geddy's history.", "Una lectura muy esperada, las memorias de Geddy Lee.", "Libro que todo fan de Rush debe leer. üëåüèΩ", "Grappig geschreven boek.

So if someone is reading my review wondering why I don't mention it, I cannot comment on what I did not read. --- One more observation, from the reviews I did look through, it seems that most people who *listened* to the book disliked it more than those who *read* it. Seems listening to it make it more difficult to follow the already jumping timeline. Again, just my observation.", "From the beginning Matthew tells us how this story is going to be written/told. How? you ask? \"Groundhog Day\" is his favorite movie, do I really need to say anything more? If you do not understand this reference, please take the time (1 hour and 40 minutes) to watch the 1993 classic movie with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. Then perhaps more things will make sense for you.", "Thankfully I have never been an alcoholic or an addict, however, I have known several in my life. For them every day is groundhog day. Every morning the question of, \"How will I get through today without a drink/pill/smoke/etc.\" makes every 24 hours the same. Matthew shows that in spades with his repetition throughout his story. Many of the reviews I saw complained about the repetition; if they don't understand it, perhaps they should count themselves lucky not to. To have never known someone who lives every day like this; or to not be that person themselves.", "Matthew's story didn't end all sunshine-and-rainbows with a happily every after. Not everyone's does. I appreciated the fact that he kept it real. That he kept it honest. That he shows his faults to us just as much as he shows us the goodness. Life isn't always polished and pretty no matter who you are or how much money you have. Matthew proves that. No matter how bad things seemed to be for him, Matthew always looked to his future, he always wanted to be there. Perhaps not always for the right reasons, but reasons that kept him moving forward nonetheless. There is something to be admired about that.", "Interestingly, one of my favorite lines reads, \"God looked down on me, just waiting it out. He's got all the time in the world. F*<k, he invented time.\" There is something raw and honest and scary and funny in those words that just made me stop reading and literally highlight it in my Kindle book. Follow that with another line I highlighted that reads, \"It was an amazing moment and a terrible moment all at at the same time.\" Talk about defining life most days. Perhaps not Pulitzer winning writing, but powerful and truthful just the same.", "I have to say my all-time favorite sentence is this one - \"God is everywhere - you just have to clear your channel, or you'll miss it.\" Doesn't matter what version of God you believe in, that sentence has a profound truth to it. (That one got highlighted in pink) Not something I would have expected from Matthew. But I am grateful he wrote it.", "I am easily giving this book all five stars for it's raw honesty, it's openness, it's imperfectness. Just like Matthew.", "Yes, I finally read his story after his sudden death on October 28, 2023. As I'm writing this on November 24, 2023, his cause of death still has not been determined nor released. Which makes one last sentence stand out for me in a premonition kind of way as I wonder what COD will turn out to be... Matthew himself wrote, \"I could have a cigarette right now, have a heart attack, and if no one was around to call 911, I was a goner.\" Well, he was home alone, and he did try to call 911 himself, but he was unable to save himself this time. Oh, Matthew.", "I wonder if you have finally found peace and all the deep, full Love you have always desired. Thank You for leaving a light on for us with your story. I pray it helps more people so that you may continue helping people even after you've gone on ahead of us in death.", "If you‚Äôre going through struggles as Matthew did, this book will be relatable and could possibly change your life.

When he announced his upcoming book, I made a mental note to purchase the book and put it in queue to read at some point. When the news hit of his passing citing ‚Äòcause of death unknown/under investigation‚Äô my curiosity peaked.", "Which brings me to my review‚Ä¶", "Matthew Perry delivered a book illustrating what it was like struggling with mental health and addiction. He shares his childhood trauma, which inevitably left him lonely with a constant longing for a loving/fulfilling relationship. I understood where he was coming from and how at the end of it all (even while having it all) he still felt empty. He went through a series of rollercoaster rides with repeated relapses and failed relationships, not to mention the millions of money spent in search for a permanent state of sobriety.", "There are criticisms on the repetitiveness within his book, in which I highly disagree. The reality is that  he was a person struggling with addiction. I found the repetitiveness to be, quite frankly, honest as most addicts fight daily inner battles: some relapse and some don‚Äôt. For Matthew Perry, his truth is that he did relapse several times. You can‚Äôt help but expect his story to be repetitive. I personally believe his memoir to be courageous, open and honest. I found no trouble with chronologically following his life‚Äôs events as others have. To me it was an easy, yet heartbreaking read.", "It‚Äôs easy to judge and think how could someone as accomplished as Matthew Perry find himself in this kind of predicament?  But on the outside looking in, we will never know what someone is going through. This was his story to tell", "I liked this book because it was a quick, easy read. The chapters were written as the late Matthew Perry sounded in cadence.  I appreciated that it had an entire glimpse and first-hand perspective as to who he was and what he was dealing with as far as the layers of his addictions. Perry was raw about it.  He told truths about abandonment and addiction that showed a direct correlation in his life.  He shares quotes and thoughts that will leave you feeling validated and seen but also with compassion and an understanding of addiction as the disease it is today and what it was to him. Mr Perry captured what it was like to seek drugs, alcohol, or all of it, and to relapse multiple times. He shared what it was like to hide the addiction and to lose love over it as well.  This book is quippy and honest, with a touch of reality and grit.  It's inspiring and beautiful work that should be shared with those struggling or that have overcome addiction, or abandonment. It's splendidly written, and it is a shame we lost him. This book is a beautiful reminder of the late Matthew Perry's truths.", "Reading this book, and knowing that he is gone, almost feels like he is talking from the grave. So sad. He had such potential. He tries to not blame his parents, but to no avail. They were self-centered individuals, and essentially abandoned him almost from birth. He made attempts to save himself, but in the end, he couldn't. Heartbreaking.", "Loved every bit of it.", "Hes a wonderful writer and has a great sense of humor.", "Great history there.", "Como una de las millones de fans de Friends y Chandler, puedo decir que este ha sido un libro que me ha acercado mucho m√°s a una persona que sent√≠a conocer de toda la vida; pero que, conozco realmente por primera vez.

It is a beautiful story, very honest, and I highly recommended it to any fan or Henry Winkler, whether you only knew him as Fonzie or not, there is a lot more to this man than just playing the Fonz!", "Amazing read. No punches pulled here..honesty and transparency! What a roller coaster but never gave up and showed the world who he really was.", "I had read Ron Howard's book so some things about Happy Days were \"repeats\" but I loved hearing it through Henry's eyes and perspective. He had a sad but interesting childhood and his honesty was appreciated. It forms part of what you deal with later. I ached that he and so many were thought of as \"dumb\" and his resilience in fighting that to get what he wanted, his dream of acting. That was also very honest and he told of his high points and low points and what he did right and wrong.", "I felt I knew him a little bit better when done and hope to see more of him in the future.  I also still chuckle over his Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger comments. ; )", "I saw Henry Winkler talk about this book on a NBC morning news interview and he is such an interesting man, I thought I'd buy this book.

Henry writes with wisdom, humor, warmth and humanity.", "We can all dig a little deeper and do a little better and reading this book will inspire you to do exactly that.", "Who would have thought that someone as cool as the Fonz struggled with dyslexia and self doubt?  Well, we are all human.  Even our favorite stars are human.  Regular people forget that sometimes.  Henry Winkler does a beautiful job telling his life story.  He has a passion for acting.  It's nice to know he still enjoys that passion and enjoys working and creating.

Cute photos and funny quote bubbles. I would recommend. Fun for dads who have daughters and are into Star Wars!

It assumes that Darth knew Luke and Leia were his children, that Han, Chewie and the rest of the characters lived nearby and were friends, etc. You need to know about the Star Wars films for the books to be funny, but they really are. This title is one of the best in the series.  I bought this book for a baby because her father is a huge Star Wars fan, and I know he will enjoy reading it to her for many years.", "I grew up, loving Star Wars, and I‚Äôm hoping to pass that along to my daughter. I thought this would be a fun book that she can keep and hopefully relate to as she grows up. All of the comics in this book are really funny because they are relatable and I can definitely see these situations happening between my husband and my daughter. Hopefully it can bring light to some difficult situations she will have growing up.", "Love all these books but this was our favorite!", "My almost 2-year old daughter really enjoys having this book read to her.  Unlike ", ", which just has Luke as a young child, this covers Leia growing up from a child to a teenager.  Because of this some of the pages are beyond my daughter's understanding of humor and are definitely aimed more at the parent.  However since I end up describing many of the scenes to her I can still tailor the pages to her interest or skip past the page entirely if it's boring to her since there are plenty of other pages to read.  The drawing style is very cute and includes plenty of little details and characters in the background that you will notice new things each time you read the book if you look.", "This book is a fun take on what it might have been like for Darth Vader to raise his daughter and captures the same everyday situations the rest of us have been in, just with a galactic twist.  A fun read, whether or not you read it to your child.", "This book is pretty good, but Vader and Son is better. I think it just made me expect more for this one. It still has some Star Wars references, nice drawings, funny moments, but it feels shorter, and I wasn't as fond of the preteen rebelious Leia jokes-- maybe because I dont have a preteen yet? Maybe I'll like it more when my daughter is older.", "This is the perfect gift for a Star Wars (SW) lover and his daughter. It's cute with references that the father will get but the child will enjoy. I found this book while browsing through amazon, but I originally saw the author's work through Reddit. The author is active in the community and his comics have always had that slightly sarcastic and playful tone that I think all ages can enjoy.", "While the book is clearly not representative of the true father-daughter relationship these two had, there are plenty of humanizing moments that really make you connect to the characters in the book, and might even teach a valuable lesson in parenting (or two).", "If you or someone you know is really into SW (and especially if they have a daughter), I'd recommend this book. It's really lighthearted and fun for anyone and everyone familiar with the series.", "This is very much like the Darth Vader and Son book.  Same artwork and witty humor.  This book centers around Princess Lea from a young girl through her teen years, not just as a little girl.  Very cute for any parent that is also a star wars fan.  If you aren't a  Star Wars fan you probably won't get a lot of it though since other character like Han Solo are represented during the \"dating\" phase :)", "If you need to get a happy present for someone, a gift under a price limit, someone who's kids are going off to college!!!!!  or have a new parent in your life, this is a GREAT gift to have them laughing at and remembering the little things they went through while raising their daughter.

Ive been an unwavering fan since the early 80's and was devestated. I have to tell you that this was one AMAZING read! It's an honest and soulful look into the man behind the voice that could have melted Mother Teresa's panties off. The writing really captured his devilish wild side, kindness and wit. Throughout the mayhem,subtances, health challanges, grief & pain this man endured, he gifted us with the most incredible music this side of heaven. He rocked us until the end. This book is such a wonderful tribute.", "Interesting biography of the life of Jack Russell, best known as the lead singer of the rock band Great White. The author made it a very easy read. Not boring it all. I finished it quickly. I liked the interviews with friends, acquaintances, former bandmates, etc. It provided an interesting view into the subject's life. I felt all types of emotions while reading this book. I liked him, I admired him, I loathed him, I felt sorry for him, and not necessarily in that order. I paid a little bit more for the pre-order, but that's ok. I knew it going in and I enjoyed reading the book. Well worth the read...in my opinion.", "The beginning really grabbed me. Thought I knew about the rock and roll scene but I guess not. I remember the Station night club fire and heard it was the band‚Äôs fault but after reading about what really happened it made me angry that this talented and really good natured guy took the rap. Great read and the interviews at the end were terrific", "Overall, I did enjoy this book. And the stories jumped around just enough to keep my a.d.d. like attention span interested. The part I found to be disappointing was the lack of editing. It's like this book was never proof read before it was printed. The amount of typos, broken sentences, and repeated sentences were all throughout the book. And I found that to be distracting at times. Hopefully they do a revised version and fix that at some point. And the hype about the final words. Yet no mention who actually wrote them?", "I'm still glad I read it aside from the editorial misses. Rest in Peace Jack Russell.", "Excellent and very well written. Released just a few weeks before Jack passed away. It‚Äôs a must read for JRGW friends and fans."]},

There are plenty of those out there, and if that's all you're wanting (or willing) to engage, go read one of those.", "If, however, you are interested in an exploration not only of George Jones and Tammy Wynette, two of the greatest voices (and most tragic figures) to have emerged from the landscape of 20th century music, irrespective of genre, but ALSO of the cultural developments within western civilization that functioned as the sociocultural \"primordial ooze\" of the worlds that birthed their respective ways-of-being - which is to say, the context within which Jones and Wynette existed - then I can say, with a remarkably high measure of confidence, that you will NEVER encounter a finer tome on the subject.", "It is, however, not told in a straightforward, cookie-cutter manner. You'll be disappointed if you buy this expecting it to be one of those biographies that gets churned out en masse, following a simple \"Birth & Childhood > Early Career > Heights of Success > Career Decline & Later Years > Death & Legacy\"-type template. There's nothing wrong with that model; done well, it can be quite efficient as a vehicle for covering necessary details and broad strokes of a life with an economy of words and pages. But author Tyler Mahan Coe determined - rightfully so, I would submit - that the lives of Jones and Wynette, and the details of their lives which must be discussed, are far too multifaceted to be adequately covered in one of those standard color-by-number jobs, precisely BECAUSE these lives are far too complex and complicated to be understood by readers who don't have at least a conversational knowledge of the many disparate sociocultural threads that shaped them.", "Why spend time on matters such as bullfighting, moonshining, and medieval jousting (among many, many others) in a book about two famous country music artists? Because, for those paying attention, there are throughlines that serve to directly link 16th century European political and religious conflict, 19th century Spanish matadors, and early 20th century Appalachian manufacturers of illicit corn whiskey to the world of country music circa the mid-to-late 20th century, where our subjects lived, worked, struggled, suffered, and ultimately made their mark on the world.", "This is not a book for someone who wants to learn the essential details as quickly as possible and move on. This is a book for those who want to savor the ecstasies and experience the agonies of Jones's and Wynette's music and lives within the broader context of the world that shaped them. If that sounds like a good time, this is a must-read.", "I rarely give up on a book, but I could not continue with Cocaine and Rhinestones. As others have noted, the book is filled with irrelevant information, which is discussed at length. Owen Bradley compares music to ice cream? Let's delve into the history of refrigeration, which made the mass production of ice cream possible. The chapter beginning with an account of bullfighting did it for me. I never did learn much about George or Tammy.", "Tyler Mahan Coe does an amazing job of setting the tone for this heartbreaking story. The author gives a thorough background of the people and places this story comes from rich with real life detail and does a great job of informing the audience that this work can be enhanced by supplementing it with various audio resources and songs. Much like the podcast that this work is descended from the author‚Äôs appreciation of country music as an art form and love of it as entertainment shines through. If you are a George jones fan I definitely recommend giving this one a read! The author does a great job of making jones a sympathetic character while not covering up the harsher realities of the person he was. Ditto with Tammy. She is presented in a fair and understanding light while also acknowledging the selfishness and other less than desirable tendencies people will choose to overlook in icons. All in all a well told story and well written book. Give it a read if you have any interest in country music, love or American celebrity. Great job Mr Coe can‚Äôt wait to read the next one!", "The illustrations are scary and you cover everything about country living before you even get to George. Do you ever get to George and Tammy?  I gave up after quite a few chapters.  I did learn a lot about moonshine and vinal records tho.", "I am listener to his Cocaine and Rhinestones Podcast, so I was definitely happy to buy and read this.", "This not a traditional biography and it contains interludes that include everything from Medieval history, moonshine, bullfighting and the Nashville Studio system in the 1950s through 1970s. All of these things add to set the scene of the story. As the book is adapted from his podcast, written as if you are being told a story, rather than what would may expect from a more traditional writing style.", "The story is a tragedy. It will rip your guts out.", "It's also immersive and damn difficult to walk away from. Many may find the interlude chapters off putting, but I personally do not. The twists and turns keep me intrigued. If you don't want to be challenged by what you're reading, this book is not for you. But if you want to get immersed in a story of American music stars that will challenge and wreck you, this is the book.", "PADDED with useless chapters about world history. (?) The Medicis? The Incas? LONG bios of other artists and minor players."]},

From the very first page, the reader is transported into a world of passion, intrigue, and high-stakes deception. This isn't just a book; it's an odyssey that delves deep into the human psyche, exploring the lengths people will go for love and obsession.", "The narrative is as exquisitely crafted as the artworks it chronicles. The author masterfully weaves together multiple storylines, shedding light on the often shadowy underworld of art theft, where fortunes change hands in the blink of an eye and trust is as rare as a genuine Rembrandt. The characters are intricate and multi-dimensional, transcending the typical archetypes of criminals and victims. The interplay of their motivations ‚Äì from love to greed, ambition to revenge ‚Äì paints a vivid picture of humanity in all its flawed beauty.", "The love story at the heart of this saga is as mesmerizing as any of the stolen masterpieces. It reminds us that beneath the veneer of crime lies a tale as old as time: the pursuit of connection and understanding. It's a poignant reminder that love, in all its forms, can drive us to extremes, both noble and nefarious.", "The pacing is impeccable. Each chapter brings with it a new revelation, a twist, or a deeper insight, making it nigh impossible to put down. The balance between the meticulous details of the art world and the raw emotions of the characters is nothing short of masterful.", "But beyond the captivating story and the poetic prose, \"The Art Thief\" also raises profound questions about the value we place on art and the lengths we'll go to possess it. Is it the monetary value that drives this obsession, or is it something deeper, more primal? The book challenges us to reflect on the role of art in our lives and the price we're willing to pay for beauty.", "In conclusion, \"The Art Thief: A True Story of Love, Crime, and a Dangerous Obsession\" is a tour de force, a masterpiece in its own right. It's a tale that lingers long after the final page, urging us to look beyond the surface and find the stories hidden in the shadows. An absolute must-read for anyone who loves art, mysteries, or the complexities of the human heart.", "I like non-fiction that reads as fiction. I read this book in one day because it was so fascinating. The writing made me feel I was there when he took the art, and if it was fiction, I would say no way could they get away with that. Museums are places I love to visit when we travel, and I can see wanting quiet and space to appreciate the pieces. But I have trouble making the jump to him, thinking he should just take them. Great book.", "This book was amusing and shocking all at the same time.  People that steal art objects are not a singular group of people - motives are as varied as the people that steal them.  This particular thief, having a truly selfish love of the objects, was particularly entertaining and extremely well read and informed about his thefts.  And he was innovative and adept at his thievery skills.  It was also a game to steal and a challenge.  The author, getting information straight from the thief himself, made the story even more intriguing.  This book is very entertaining read.", "It was well written and reseached...amazing insanity on all the participants.", "I purchased this book from Amazon based on their recommendation. The author wrote the book with narrative through out that explains what happened after arrests are made. I believe Mr. Finkel did an excellent job leading the reader into Breitwieser's gradual lust for stealing art. I really can't imagine how he ever thought this would end of well. Then again, I don't think he really cared. Personally, I believe he had a thirst for the excitement of stealing and since he loved/studied art why not. Breitwieser had worked for a short time as a security guard at a small museum and learned security or good security is not affordable for these size museums. He of course took full advantage of this knowledge.", "After a bit, one theft became many and the reader may get a little fatigued reading about all of them. The detail is amazing on each theft.  It seems Breitwieser has a fantastic memory with one description relayed by the author as him telling about each screw being removed to obtain a piece of art. So as I'm starting to think about skipping a few paragraphs, my attention is completely swept up by his capture. The story takes many an interesting twist and turn which had my full attention.", "All in all a very entertaining book. Buy it!", "Intriguing, educational, and sad all at the same time.  I don‚Äôt usually go for non-fiction but this book has me hooked.", "The topic of art heists is fascinating, but I found the last third of it disturbing.", "I greatly enjoyed reading this book, so well researched and prepared over a decade of fact finding and interviews.  The author tried to remain neutral despite the shocking and repulsive behavior of the characters in the book.", "It is the story of a very spoiled, selfish, narcissist enabled by his mother, maternal grandparents, and girlfriend.  His mother and girlfriend were complicit in his actions. No moral compass until caught by law enforcement, but even then the thief seemed arrogant and expressed no regret!", "This story is compelling in that it shows what greed resides in a person's soul and there's no remorse, no consequences, no mind what the cost in the destruction of valuable art artifacts, no matter who it affects. It is a story I'll probably read again,it is so unbelievable.", "Muy buen libro, historia real, sobre algo que me gusta. El arte.", "leichtes lesen ,Beach etc ...", "A beautifully portrayed horrific true life story‚Ä¶must read.. made my blood boil till the very end, the author deserves a standing ovation.", "Highly entertaining book - if you didn‚Äôt appreciate it was a true story you would like it was ‚Äòover the top‚Äô fictional - an unbelievable story well told."]},

Richards was a foundational member of the greatest sitcom ever produced. The behind-the-scenes is fascinating, and his whole life and preparation leading up to the breakthrough defining role is worth reading.

The problem with the book is that it needs focus‚Ä¶it is all over the place. He intersperses his pseudo-philosophy throughout and it comes off as a bit bizarre. A good editor would have reeled this in since it isn‚Äôt what readers are interested about. As with most celebrities, we enjoy their characters and find their real selves to be less interesting. The book could be cut in half if they remove the asides.", "It was a gift for my husband, he loved it. Interesting and humorous!", "This book is not written by Kramer if that's what you were hoping for. It's written by Michael Richards who is nothing like Kramer. He's an actor that plays a very different person than who he actually is. He's a very spiritual guy, very deep into theater and writes in a non-conventiinal way.  If you want to get to know Michael, the actor and here a few stories about Seinfeld too, then I'd recommend this book. If your expecting something from Kramer, then pass on it.", "This was hard to put down. As a longtime Seinfeld fan I especially enjoyed learning how the character of Kramer was constructed, and how different Richards is. The spiritual side was interesting as well, and I look forward to something more explicit. But for Seinfeld fans, this is a must-read.", "I have long been a fan of Michael‚Äôs.

Why is a couple whose celebrity has become so enormous so quickly without professional management for business & social purposes? John's magazine was launched just as the internet starting the decline in paper magazines why not push re-set with business management?

Of Romani/Gypsy ancestry, my Gran started me on sketching my own deck at age 8 using woodchips scattered on the cellar floor from her husband‚Äôs woodworking. I continued it until marriage and later made another deck after menopause, but neither one invoked the necessary bonding I am still seeking in my old age.  I will add that the Romani had what my Gran called the Drom Ek Romani (Way of One Gypsy) cards/wood chips centuries before the decks became popular during the Renaissance, but that is an oral tradition with no proof. I believe Katy Hays brilliantly tapped into the feelings upon discovering the deck that seems to reveal the secrets of life.  And, anyone who has ever tried to break into academic life with a mere B.A. degree from a not-quite-right university would have to love the book and cheer on the main character, also portrayed in a wonderful way by Katy Hays.  However, it has always been difficult for me to like a book if we discover that certain characters are morally flawed beyond our own standards, but I will not indulge in spoilers.  The book is also special because it somehow morphs into a psychological thriller and a mystery and I found that to be a treat on so many levels.  A five-star read, for me.", "‚ÄúWhat if our whole life‚Äîhow we live and die‚Äîhas already been decided for us?‚Äù", "So this book gave off the creepy ominous vibes pretty early on and I was in love. I always find that I enjoy the academia type stories more than I anticipated and this one having tarot cards as the focus was really cool. I think what I enjoyed most about this one was that even though it had this supernatural element... the motivations were all so normal. Ambition, love, betrayal, power, envy, anger all of them played a crucial role of the story and the unfolding of events. Ann is very much motivated by her desire to be an academic and Rachel becomes someone she clings to and trusts because of the power she radiates.", "Ann is very skeptical of the importance that Patrick places on the tarot cards at first but I love how we gradually see her perception shift, almost to fit her motives. The book really highlights the stark contrast between the idea of fate and choice and I loved the way it did. I have to say that at times the book felt like it was dragging just a bit and I really wanted some action to happen. I was a little disappointed that the tarot cards weren't providing a bit more of an occult element but like I can forgive it because of the way things played out.", "The book really saved all its shock for the end. I have to admit that I didn't see the ending coming and I truly loved the shock reveals we got. I enjoyed all the ways that ambition and obsession played out in this story. I love that it kept the creepy vibes going the whole time but I feel like some elements could have been explored a bit more. Overall though it was a really good read and now I am on the search for more stories with tarot cards at the center.", "As I live a few blocks from the Cloisters, am a member there (via the Met), and visit there often, I try my best to read anything that uses the Cloisters as a setting.  Somewhat surprisingly, this is actually the second novel I‚Äôve read with the Cloisters as a key setting.  Unfortunately, this novel is not nearly as engaging as James Carroll‚Äôs The Cloister.", "In this novel, a young woman named Ann Stilwell comes from Washington to NYC with a degree in art and a summer job at the Met.  On the verge of losing her job on day 1, she is scooped up by Patrick Roland, the curator of the Cloisters and begins working there.  She becomes friends with associate curator Rachel Mondray and gardener Leo Bitburg.  The art historians are working on a exhibition of tarot cards, and become enamored of the idea that divination with the cards is quite possible.", "There are some good things here.  There is the interesting fish-out-of-water experience of Ann trying to fit in with the artsy culture of NYC.  The relationships Ann develops with Leo and, especially, Rachel are engaging in certain aspects.  Also, unlike a number of novels I‚Äôve read lately, this novel finishes strong, with some surprising, yet not outrageous, revelations.", "The main word that comes to me when I think of this novel, however, is vague.  This is its major problem.  I was unhappy with her descriptions of the Cloisters.  Despite knowing the place well, I couldn‚Äôt picture the spaces she was trying to describe.  And was she restricted from naming the artwork on display there?  The pieces she describes could be found in any museum and the Unicorn tapestries, which are the Cloisters most famous holdings, don‚Äôt even rate a mention.  Worse, the movement towards a belief in the power of the tarot is almost completely undeveloped.  There was nothing in the characterizations here that actually made me believe that the characters believed.", "In the end, this book was a disappointment.  I got the feeling that Ms. Hays had maybe visited the Cloisters once or twice but never got to know the place well.  Her descriptions of the neighborhood in which I live lacked any kind of precision that would give the novel a feeling of place.  Though the story is a fair one, there‚Äôs nothing about it that makes me think the Cloisters was where this novel had to take place.", "This book is not the same old, same old kind of mystery. It starts slow and builds steadily, however, as the main character evolves the plot takes twists and turns that are refreshingly different. I learned a tremendous amount during my reading journey, which is also‚Äîfor me‚Äîthe mark of a well written book. The characters are not typical, and if you don't have to feel like you'd like to be best friends with the main character in order to like a book, this may be a good choice for you. The setting is atmospheric, the characters are unique, and the plot is unusual. I enjoyed the book very much and if you like that which is different, yet still creative, well written, and entertaining . . . I highly recommend this book!", "Having quite recently visited the Cloisters for the first time, I was drawn to this novel.  It did prove to be a rewarding read, although I found the ending puzzling. I particularly enjoyed the emphasis on the Tarot, a subject I have recently become enamored of. The characters were well-described and the plot caught my interest throughout. As the story reached its climax, I feared a conventional movie-type ending, but was pleasantly surprised. I anticipate Hays‚Äô next novel.", "Muito bem escrito", "I really enjoyed the majority of the book which focused on the casting of fates, the different ways in which various religions and civilisations looked at divining the future and the history of tarot. What surprised me was the direction the book quite quickly took in its latter stages. Won't go into detail to avoid spoilers, but I found it quite unnecessary and would have been happier if the original concept had been adhered to as I felt that story still had plenty to give. Have to say I found the final set of revelations were akin to a plot from a struggling soap opera. Still, prior to the end, I thought the book was well written, characterisations were good and descriptions of the Cloisters brought the place alive", "Slow chapters aside, a perfect read.", "Libro arrivato perfettamente, copertina meravigliosa, l'unica differenza rispetto a quanto visto in foto (ed √® per questo che gli ho dato 4 stelle invece di 5) √® la mancanza del/dei segnalibri visto/i nelle foto di presentazione del prodotto. Non √® un elemento essenziale, ma mi sembrava giusto farlo presente.", "Amazon velocissimo come sempre, ottimo servizio, personale sempre molto gentile."]},

Through relatable anecdotes, practical advice, and profound wisdom, the book guides readers on a journey of self-discovery and liberation from mental, emotional, and spiritual bondage.", "2. **Clear and Engaging Writing:** Written in a clear and engaging style, the book captivates readers from start to finish, making complex concepts accessible and applicable to everyday life. The author's authentic voice and heartfelt messages resonate with readers, inspiring them to embark on their own paths to freedom and fulfillment.", "3. **Practical Strategies:** \"Becoming Free Indeed\" provides practical strategies and actionable steps for overcoming obstacles, breaking free from limiting beliefs, and embracing a life of purpose and authenticity. Readers will find valuable tools and exercises to apply in their own lives, empowering them to create positive change and manifest their deepest desires.", "4. **Spiritual Guidance:** Rooted in spiritual principles and biblical teachings, \"Becoming Free Indeed\" offers profound spiritual guidance for those seeking deeper meaning and connection in their lives. The book encourages readers to cultivate faith, trust, and surrender as they embark on their journey towards true freedom and wholeness.", "**Cons:**", "1. **Religious Focus:** While the spiritual perspective of \"Becoming Free Indeed\" may resonate with some readers, others may find the heavy emphasis on religious themes and biblical references to be limiting or exclusionary, especially those from different faith backgrounds or belief systems.", "2. **Lack of Diversity:** The book may lack diversity in perspectives and experiences, potentially alienating readers who do not see themselves represented in the narratives or examples provided. A more inclusive approach that acknowledges a wider range of identities and backgrounds could enhance the book's relevance and appeal to a broader audience.", "3. **Overly Prescriptive:** Some readers may find certain sections of \"Becoming Free Indeed\" to be overly prescriptive or formulaic in their approach to personal growth and transformation. While the book offers valuable guidance, individual journeys to freedom and fulfillment may vary, and a more flexible and open-ended approach could accommodate diverse paths to self-discovery.", "4. **Limited Depth:** Despite its valuable insights and practical advice, \"Becoming Free Indeed\" may lack the depth and complexity found in more comprehensive self-help or spiritual growth books. Readers seeking a deeper exploration of specific topics or concepts may find themselves craving more detailed analysis and exploration beyond the book's surface-level discussions.", "Overall, \"Becoming Free Indeed\" offers valuable guidance and inspiration for those seeking personal freedom, spiritual growth, and fulfillment. While it may have limitations in terms of its religious focus, lack of diversity, and prescriptive approach, its empowering content and practical strategies make it a valuable resource for anyone on a journey of self-discovery and transformation.", "This is truly a good read for anyone struggling with faith or fear because of past religious experiences. This book sheds light on what true faith is.", "There's a lot of talk floating around these days about Christians who are deconstructing their faith. These are Christians whom the church has wounded deeply, hurt so badly and let down so hard, they feel they can't get back up again. For many of these Christians, the church, which was supposed to be a sanctuary, has been a place of nothing but emotional, spiritual, and often physical and sexual, abuse.", "I am not that Christian. If anything, all the \"noise\" about deconstruction, false teachers (it seems every time I turn around, somebody who was once trusted is being accused of false teaching), and false doctrine, breaks my heart. I did not grow up with teachers like Bill Gothard (thank the good Lord)! My parents and family were nothing like the Duggars, and my life was not a fishbowl. Yet I have been attracted to stories like Jinger Duggar Vuolo's for years and continue to be attracted to them. Why, and among all the stories, was Jinger's any better or different?", "I'll answer those questions out of order. First, yes, Jinger's story is better and different. Second, my \"why\" is a little different from your average \"deconstructing\" Christian, but it is in their neighborhood. That is, I have not deconstructed, but chose Jinger's story because I identified with her. In a world and Christian subculture where so many are stripping faith down to the studs and leaving Jesus behind in the junk pile, I want and choose to stay true to Him. But how to do that amid all the construction noise? Because let me tell you, construction noise, literal and figurative, can get on your last blessed nerve!", "Jinger Duggar Vuolo gets that, and she wrote that story in the most honest and refreshing voice I've heard in the 2020s narrative about deconstruction and disentanglement so far. Refreshingly, she doesn't use Becoming Free Indeed to bash her parents and family, or even Bill Gothard (though he would darn well deserve it)! As she says, Becoming Free Indeed is not a tell-all. It's not scandalous.", "Instead, Jinger is gentle yet up front about the realities of her life and her faith. I could sense the dilemma that occurred in my own life--her family did what they thought right, she loves them, she embraced Jesus--but yet, that experience, and Jinger's personality and personal bent, led to a lot of anxiety and fear. Jinger knew her Bible in the way many Christian kids, including yours truly, grow up knowing it. We learn it through Bible stories and \"sword drills\" and Bible trivia (man, I used to *clean up* at that; still can). We were told to read it because it pleased God (subtext: not to read and love the Bible is to make God upset). But we (I) don't *know* the Bible like we should. Jinger knew God as Heavenly Father, but like yours truly, that was more like, \"Daddy loves you, but also, don't mess up or there'll be trouble when Daddy gets home.\"", "So yeah, Jinger and I were not \"abused\" as such, or living in abject fear, but I empathized with her and applauded her honesty and straightforward yet gentle presentation. She challenged me, but without saying, \"It's your fault for falling for this stuff\" or even, \"How could you believe what I did, you didn't grow up under Gothard\" (because I admit, I sometimes felt guilty reading this book, since I *didn't* grow up that way and thought, \"Why do I feel the way I feel?\") The message I got from Becoming Free Indeed is not, \"Christians are totally messed up and brainwashed,\" which is what the world's culture wants to tell us and where deconstruction comes from. I think Jinger and Christians like her are getting it right, in that Christians have a valid belief in *Jesus,* we've just let all this other junk get in the way.", "I do have a couple mild to moderate critiques. The first is more a question on my part, and again, this is Jinger's book, not mine. So however she chose to deal with this is fine with me. But throughout the book, I found myself responding to Gothard's teachings thus: \"Excuse you?\" \"Where do you *get* this stuff?\" \"Um, you WHAT, now?\" And yet, Jinger never questions the fact that her parents, and especially her family's little ones, still follow this man on any level. I understand she can't force them to change their belief system, and in terms of the adults, that's on them. But as much as I loved the fact that Becoming Free Indeed is not a tell-all, there were areas where I kind of wished Jinger had come down a little harder and said, \"This man is false, he is dangerous, not just because of what he's been charged with but because of but because of what his ministry does in the everyday. I still love my family but struggle with their involvement,\" or something.", "My actual critique comes from the fact that I wish I knew a bit more about Jinger's disentanglement and how it affects how she interacts with culture today. That is, like her, there are ways I interact with culture that are not specified either way in the Bible, but that I can still feel guilty or anxious over based on what other Christians do or don't do. For instance, I have been in prayer circle with older ladies who, if they knew I listened to Hamilton, Newsies, and Six: The Musical, would probably have coronaries. I have, as an adult, read, relished, and found Christian messages in Harry Potter. I disagree with Christians who have banished Disney wholesale from their homes. I am a disabled and autistic woman who wants to speak of systemic ablesim but hesitates to do so for fear of being accused of being \"woke\" (same for systemic racism, by the way). I disagree with corporal punishment even though 90% of my fellow Christians claim it's biblical and that my disagreement is mild to moderate rebellion in and of itself.", "Okay, so you get it. My point is, Jinger does give a few examples like this, and I appreciate those (yes, I confess, I have a pixie cut and I wear pants to church. I can't even remember the last time I wore a dress, period). But within our culture, I feel like a lot of those examples are kind of...is the word \"obvious?\" I wish she had gone into some more \"current\" or controversial examples, like the Disney thing or the corporal punishment thing. And yes, even more controversial doctrines--and I think we all know what I mean. Because the Bible is clear on those, but they may not be \"essential doctrines,\" and are they the hills Christians want to die on? (As in, yes, I will 100% accept persecution for believing Jesus is the only way to Heaven and is the Son of God, but some of this other stuff? Am I willing to risk it? Not sure).", "Anyway, that's the long way to say, I don't have critiques as much as I do questions. I wish Jinger and I could just grab some tea or coffee and talk some more (and as far as social anxiety, I get it. Don't worry girl, I got you). But in the absence of that, Becoming Free Indeed is still well worth the read. I dare say it will in some way refresh your soul.", "I got this for a book club and it wasn't what I was looking for.  Although, her story is good, I didn't connect with her at times.", "If you saw the Duggars when they were kids, you need to read this. It doesn't bash the parents, just the views of how they were raised. Jinger does a great job bringing to light how they really are and what they should be really teaching", "Thank you my sister in Christ.", "I strongly resonated with what you said about your social anxiety and the pain of leaving everything you once believed behind.", "So much of this book reminded me of myself and my journey.", "God bless you and your family.", "Love you Sister üíï", "As a preacher I found the honesty and journey to be so truthful and accurate. Jesus is everything we will ever need for all time he is our friend.", "Jinger has exposed a cult like group with grace and truth. I pray this book will be helpful for others seeking to disentangle themselves from man-made systems.", "This book was mostly just different bible verses with Jinger explaining what Gothard had interpreted them to mean compared to what she now \"knows\" they really mean. I feel like Jinger has left one cult & is now in a slightly less strict cult. Apart from a few small anecdotes about her life there wasn't much of interest, it was just her interpretation of what she now believes.  (Or has been told to believe.)", "I‚Äôm giving this book 4 stars because I found it to be well written and it was a very easy read. I found the courage inspirational and I always love hearing other people‚Äôs stories. My only negative on this book was that it was verrrrrrry religious oriented. I expected this getting into the book, but there were times it almost came across preachy. Otherwise I really enjoyed it."]},

I usually do not spend this much on a book however, I saw the author discussing the book multiple times on MSNBC and knew he was going to tell a honest story about someone we think we know very well. I was also drawn in in regards to the time Trump was on The Apprentice. It was a good show for the first few years. Trump came across as a smart and yes at times a compassionate business man. It is unbelievably jarring how someone can present as someone who seems kind and decent and eventually exposes to literally the world exactly who he really is. The book is worth reading because the author has managed to encapsulates this man Trump so very well."]},

Each home featured also shows a floorplan and background info on the owners and why they chose that location/build. Lots of inspo here!  I will say though, my rating is more like a 4.5 stars because of two things: A. I was looking for inspo on tiny houses (my fault: the book IS called \"Bigger than Tiny\", afterall.)... But then it says \"Smaller than Average\" which is funny to me because most of those houses are bigger than mine, and I have an \"average\" house for my area (1500sqf in South Florida) so the book should really just be called \"really nice smaller to average-sized homes\" lol.  Also, since the book aims to inspire those looking to build smaller, eco-friendly homes, I was a little disappointed to not find cost info (preferably a breakdown but even just a total cost would have been good)...

I have read many books on The Astor Family, and various members of it, and was really looking forward to this book. Maybe I just had too high expectations from Cooper's previous books.", "First I feel that Cooper is holding a personal vendetta against the Astor family. He makes it quite clear when discussing Brooke Astor's (apparent) snubbing of him when he was not with his mother at Mortimer's. As a seasoned journalist I would think Cooper wouldn't be so biased, but its all over the book. Clearly in Cooper's eyes the Vanderbilts were better than the Astors. I am sure (and I hope) that IRL Cooper doesn't still hold this apparent grudge against a family, but by reading the book you would think we were back in The Gilded Age and Anderson was not invited to Mrs. Astor's balls.", "My larger issue is that a book that for me should have been like reading my favorite type of candy this book was very dull at points. There are countless pages about things that I feel could have been explained in one or two pages (such as the massacre at the Astor House). I was shocked to find some parts of this book tedious for me to get through.", "If you don't know much about the Astor Family this does give you a full picture of the family origins and how they got where they got to, but I'd probably recommend something a little less biased.", "I am not sorry I got this book. It's a great package, and the authors are quite talented. It just wasn't what I was expecting. Still will buy future books by Cooper in the hopes they keep me as interested as his prior works.", "Very informative", "I enjoyed this book vey much. I loved reading about a lot of the history that helped make this country what it is today  and the lives of the super rich in how so many of them started out with nothing and ended up with untold riches. It may all sound grand but it's not the life I would want to live. Being super rich as so many in this book became, does not make you a happy person.", "interesting and engaging and perfect for the drive home from vacation in Acadia to home in the Berkshire Hills.

That said however it is still an engaging, if haphazard, read.", "My greatest issue with it however is the glaring historical inaccuracies. The greatest example is that of John Jacob Astor IV, the most famous Astor of them all, the great man who lost his life on the Titanic.

(It's refreshing to see a celebrity, who, after they've made it, still loves and respects those raised him.)", "Selleck goes on to tell us of his basically accidental entry into show business, and how people helped him progress.  He never says, 'I did this by myself,' and credits everyone who assisted him along the way.", "He ends the book as 'Magnum' ends, so one hopes there's a second volume coming out, as Tom Selleck obviously has a great deal more to write about:  'Blue Bloods,' his work for TNT, QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER and other fine motion pictures.  Let's hope there is another volume coming out.", "Tom's style is that of a good friend who speaks from the heart. I love his expression, \"I'm a bricklayer, one brick at a time.\" That is how he built his career. He had setbacks, and his quote from the book is, \"The second kick from a mule is not educational. He knew he wanted to build his acting career and watched and learned from other successful artists.", "Tom's story is inspirational and fun to read, and his casual conversational style seems personal as if he were writing to me.", "He is a good writer, and I highly recommend his memoir.

I've watched all the Magnum PI tv shows (loved the raised eyebrows he did in the show previews), the Blue Bloods tv show, all the western movies he's been in, the Jesse Stone made for tv movies. What an actor & that mustache! His memoir book is a very good read. He tells you about his childhood days, his acting classes as well as trying out for the tv/movie parts, his strong values in general. When you read his actual comments, I felt as though I was right there in the room with him/them. What a great man! I will definitely read this again!", "I have always liked Tom‚Äôs films and tv shows so I thought it may be interesting.  It begins with the start of his career and all along thru the years you learn of his actual personality and what he believes in. I don‚Äôt believe his career was ever easy for him but as he proceeded forward he learned the trade and changed it a little to blend with his personality to work.", "I did enjoy the book a lot.", "If you are looking for a great book to read this summer, this book is it.  Completely entertaining and inspirational.  Mind you, I am already a Tom Selleck fan, not only because I respect him as an actor, but as a person.  Having watched Magnum P. I. over and over again it was great to read about all that brought this series together, but see him be humble and gracious to all he dealt with.  Apprecitiated how he instills the benefits of having great parents and upbringing.  It plays to the person he became and is  today.  Thank you Tom for this novel.", "YOU NEVER KNOW is an apt title of this book, because you don't come out of this really knowing much about Selleck, except that he wants to be seen as a very nice guy, doesn't want to criticize anyone, and wants to keep his private life private, even in a memoir. It feels like he is playing the character \"Tom Selleck\" in the book, and not really being himself.", "Overall it's a lazily written disappointment (he must use the term \"above my paygrade\" ten times in the book) that basically ends after the final episode of MAGNUM.  He devotes a scant three or four pages to BLUE BLOODS, a show he's been doing for 13 years. Everyone is wonderful, nice and talented, even Glen A. Larson, who Selleck threw off of the MAGNUM pilot.", "It's basically a series of anecdotes about the first half of his career (primarily MAGNUM) and his romance with his wife. Not a harsh, or even remotely critical word, is said about any one he worked with or any experience that he had.", "That said, for TV buffs, he does go into a lot of production details about his busted pilots (MOST WANTED, BUNCO, GYPSY WARRIORS, BOSTON & KILBRIDE), his ROCKFORD guest shots, THE SACKETTS, MAGNUM and the movies HIGH ROAD TO CHINA, LASSITER, and THREE MEN AND A BABY.  So for that TV stuff, especially about the pilots, it was well worth the cover price for me.", "What he inexplicably doesn't talk about are all of his other movies and TV shows after MAGNUM, like IKE, MONTE WALSH, MR. BASEBALL, RUNAWAY, his failed sitcom THE CLOSER, his stint on FRIENDS, his season on LAS VEGAS, his JESSE STONE movies, producing BL STRYKER and hardly anything about BLUE BLOODS.", "It's as if he just got bored with the book and decided he was done. I can't blame him. By the end, I felt the same way.", "If you're a fan of his, Mr Selleck talks alot about how he started and how his career progressed from the 60s through the 90s. Not too much on his Blue Bloods years, nor the non-acting private facets of his life.", "He does not reveal anyone else's dark secrets either, he writes with some personal integrity and with kind words and nice stories about some amazing people from older Hollywood and his peers.", "It was an enjoyable read if you want to get to know a bit about the man and the Hollywood he experienced.", "A very refreshing book. Tom Selleck will always be Magnum to me. Even though I was too young to watch the series or remember a single episode fully, everything I have seen him in over the decades, my first thought is always it Magnum.", "If you are looking for a tell-all, name, and shame story, this is definitely not the book for you. I say this book is refreshing because it is almost universally accepted how toxic and cut throat the film industry is. Here Tom shows another perspective the camaraderie between actors coming up, the joy and excitement of creating great movies or tv series.", "These experiences might be coloured by Tom's humble personality, thinking the best of people or his mindset to always make the best of every situation he is in. This makes Tom Selleck an extremely likeable person. Yes, serendipity and luck had a hand in his success, but he is the one who \"layed the bricks,\" learned his craft, and did his best in the situations.", "Tom keeps his personal life (and army career) very close to his chest. He hardly talks about these except key milestones. He does give full credit to all the people he worked with and met over the years. One thing that made me lose a lot of respect for another actor was in their autobiography. They wrote a chapter where a veteran actor (who they name) saved their life by getting stuntman to do a stunt before them, the stuntman that dies his their place is not named. The fact that Tom did name people who took bumps for him or (indirectly) pait the ultimate price for him is a great show of humanity.", "This book spans from Tom's serendipitous start in acting to the final season of Magnum. His post work after that is done in a chapter of him looking back. This is an excellent book, of a good person, but also sees good in others, but is not afraid to stand his ground.", "Pedido rapido y correcto,todo perfecto,una pieza de coleccion para los seguidores del actor.", "Produkten kom tidigare √§n utlovat.
